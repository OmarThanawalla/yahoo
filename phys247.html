Ever since their discovery in 1984,[<A
 HREF="node5.html#She84">1</A>] quasicrystals have posed a
perplexing puzzle:
Why do the atoms form
a complex, quasiperiodic
  pattern rather than a regularly-repeating, crystal arrangement?
Most explanations have been based on some analogy with tilings.
For example, in the Penrose tiling picture,
the notion has been that 
atoms arrange themselves 
into  two types of clusters analogous to the obtuse and acute
rhombic  Penrose tiles 
and   have  interactions which
force  connections between
clusters analogous to the Penrose matching rules for tiles.[<A
 HREF="node5.html#Lev84">2</A>]  
In the original formulation of the random tiling picture,[<A
 HREF="node5.html#Hen">3</A>]
two clusters are also needed corresponding to obtuse and acute
rhombic tiles without  matching rules.
<P>
The tiling models suggest that the conditions necessary to form 
quasicrystals are significantly more complex  than the conditions
for forming crystals.
For example,
the requirement of two types of cluster  appears to be necessary to 
obtain quasiperiodicity. 
Yet, it is difficult to imagine  energetics that
permit two clusters  
in the just the right proportion in density 
(and exclude any other clusters), 
especially considering that most known quasicrystals are composed of metallic
elements with central force potentials rather than rigid covalent 
bonding.
In the case of the Penrose picture, there is the additional problem 
of finding energetics that impose the matching rules.
<P>
An important development has been the emergence of 
a new paradigm for the atomic structure of quasicrystals
which simplifies the description of quasicrystal
structure and suggests  a simple thermodynamic mechanism for  
quasicrystal formation. In the new paradigm, quasicrystals are 
described in terms of a single, repeating cluster. The repeating
cluster  is analogous to the unit cell
in  periodic crystals.
 The novel feature is that the neighboring clusters  ``overlap.&quot;
Atoms in the overlap region are shared
by the two clusters enabling
 the hypothetical surfaces that 
bound the clusters to  interpenetrate. However, the sharing
means that there is no duplication or   crowding
of atoms.
The new picture does not have a simple interpretation in terms of 
tiling; the term ``covering&quot; is more apropos. 

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
The  New  Paradigm: The Quasi-unit cell Picture</A>
</H1>
<P>
A new  picture of quasicrystals emerges in which 
the structure is  determined entirely by a single repeating cluster
which overlaps (shares atoms with) neighbor clusters according to 
simple energetics.  We first discuss the the structure in 
terms of somewhat artificial 
overlap rules, which play the same role as Penrose edge-matching rules
in forcing a unique structure isomorphic to Penrose tiling.
We then discuss how the overlap rules  may arise from 
physically plausible  energetics.
<P>
In this paper, we will focus on the case of  decagonal quasicrystals
whose quasiperiodic layers have the same symmetry as  two-dimensional
Penrose tilings. The two-dimensional analogue for the overlapping
cluster model 
consists  of  decagonal
tiles which overlap to form a covering of the two-dimensional plane.
Petra Gummelt[<A
 HREF="node5.html#Gum">15</A>] first conjectured that decagonal tiles with
appropriately chosen overlap rules can force a perfect quasiperiodic
tiling and she outlined a proof.
 Jeong and Steinhardt[<A
 HREF="node5.html#JS">16</A>]
provided a simple,
alternative proof which makes clear the isomorphism to two-tile
 Penrose tilings.
<P>
In the new paradigm,  the atomic structure of the decagonal phase is 
determined entirely by 
the atom decoration of the  overlapping decagon tiles.
The decagon tiles represent decagonal cluster columns in the
three-dimensional quasicrystals structure.
For the case of a perfect quasiperiodic structure, 
 the overlapping cluster
can be  dubbed a ``quasi-unit cell,&quot;
since it is   analogous to the 
conventional  unit cell in a perfect periodic crystal.  
However, an important difference is that  the 
atomic decoration of the quasi-unit cell is constrained:
the 
atom configuration inside the quasi-unit cell must have the property
that neighboring clusters can share atoms without significant distortion 
of their  atomic arrangements.

A quasiperiodic tiling can be forced using marked decagons shown in
(a). Matching rules demand that two decagons may overlap  only
if shaded regions overlap. This permits two possibilities in which
the overlapped area is either small (<I>A</I> -type) or large (<I>B</I> -type),
as shown in (b)&gt;
If each decagon is inscribed with 
 a large obtuse rhombus, as shown in (c), 
a  tiling of 
overlapping decagons (d, left) is converted 
into a Penrose tiling (d, right).</CAPTION>

<P>
The decagonal  quasi-unit cell is 
shown in Fig.&nbsp;1(a) 
with a decoration consisting of  kites and 
star-like shapes designed as  a mnemonic for the overlap rules.
To force a perfect quasiperiodic covering isomorphic to a Penrose 
tiling,
the decagons  are permitted to overlap only in two 
ways, <I>A</I> - or <I>B</I> -type, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;1(b). With these overlap rules,
kite regions always  overlap kite regions and star-like regions always
overlap star regions.
The isomorphism between decagons and Penrose tilings can be realized by
  inscribing each decagon with a large Penrose
obtuse rhombus tile marked with single- and double-arrows, as illustrated in
Fig. 1(c). The decagon tiling in Fig.&nbsp;1(d) is thereby converted into 
a Penrose tiling.  (Spaces are left where acute Penrose rhombi can
be inserted.)
<P>
The reduction of a Penrose tiling or decagonal phase to a single-repeating
cluster is a remarkable simplification. In terms of atomic modeling, 
it means that the entire structure is defined by the atomic decoration
of the quasi-unit cell, similar to the familiar case of periodic crystals.  
However, as an explanation for why quasicrystals form, a worrisome
aspect  is the overlap rules, which appear to require complex
energetics. Hence, a second  important
 discovery[<A
 HREF="node5.html#JS">16</A>] for the new paradigm  has been that it is possible
to avoid matching or overlap rules altogether.
Instead, a perfect Penrose tiling can arise simply by
 maximizing the density of some chosen atom cluster, <I>C</I> .
<P>
To illustrate the result,
 we idealize the discussion by considering arrangements of 
obtuse and acute rhombi, each representing some atom cluster.
We assume no matching or overlaps rules.
Without any further specifications,
  there are an  infinite number of distinct tilings possible,
 including Penrose tiling, periodic tilings, and random arrangements.
If there is no energetics to distinguish among the possibilities, 
the ground state is degenerate.

In realistic models,
it is natural to suppose that the tiles represent atom clusters 
and that some tile  cluster <I>C</I>  is low energy compared to
the others. The  degeneracy may, thereby, be broken.  Jeong and
Steinhardt[<A
 HREF="node5.html#JS">16</A>] have shown that, for an appropriately chosen 
<I>C</I>  cluster, the Penrose tiling emerges as the unique ground state.
That is, if one imagines that the
chosen cluster of tiles represents some energetically preferred
atomic cluster, then minimizing the free energy would naturally
maximize the cluster density. Jeong and Steinhardt have shown
that the Penrose tiling is the unique configuration with the maximum 
density of <I>C</I>  clusters.
<P>
An example is  the cluster <I>C</I>  shown in Fig. 2, although 
other choices are possible.[<A
 HREF="node5.html#JS2">17</A>] 
Two neighboring <I>C</I> 's
can share tiles. The greatest overlaps correspond precisely to the <I>A</I> 
and <I>B</I>  overlaps of the central decagonal region of <I>C</I> .
It is clear from this that 
   the <I>C</I> -cluster is inspired by the decagon covering described
above, although the precise relationship is quite subtle. For example,
if there are no explicit overlap rules to forbid certain arrangements 
for the <I>C</I>  cluster,
 the hexagon tabs must introduced to  prevent undesirable overlaps.
The non-trivial result is that maximizing the density of <I>C</I>  clusters
automatically leads to
 a structure in which the <I>C</I> -clusters are in one-to-one
correspondence with the quasi-unit cells in a single  decagon tiling.
 In particular, of all possible arrangements of obtuse and 
acute tiles,   the Penrose tiling is the 
unique arrangement of <I>C</I>  in which  every <I>C</I>  has an <I>A</I>  or <I>B</I> 
overlap with its neighbors.
Jeong and Steinhardt have also shown that the ground state remains
unique for a wide range of assignments of energies to clusters.

To progress beyond abstract studies of tilings,  examples
of real quasicrystals must be found which support the new paradigm.
It would be particularly useful to find an example with a
simple atomic decoration of the quasi-unit cell so that the 
correspondence is apparent.
A promising system is the decagonal phase of <I>AlNiCo</I> , one of the 
most studied quasicrystals. High resolution lattice images reveal
a network of overlapping decagonal clusters columns about 
2&nbsp;nm  in diameter.[<A

A historic difficulty with  <I>AlNiCo</I>  has been disorder and superlattice effects
which have confounded structural analysis.
Early overlapping cluster models, such as Burkov's,[<A
 HREF="node5.html#Bur1">4</A>]
characterized the structure in terms of overlapping clusters with 
decagonal or pentagonal symmetry using overlap rules which produce
random tilings. The random tiling picture seemed appropriate because
of evidence of some diffuse scattering.
<P>
Recently, however, Tsai <I>et al.</I>[<A
 HREF="node5.html#Tsai">20</A>] have found a simple decagonal
phase in water-quenched <I>Al<SUB>72</SUB>Ni<SUB>20</SUB>Co<SUB>8</SUB></I>  which exhibits no
superlattice reflections and no diffuse streaks.  
Figure 3 shows a superposition of  
the high angle annular dark-field  (HAADF) image for 
<I>Al<SUB>72</SUB>Ni<SUB>20</SUB>Co<SUB>8</SUB></I>  obtained by Saitoh <I>et al.</I>[<A
 HREF="node5.html#Saitoh">21</A>]
and a single decagon tiling.
The bright spots in the HAADF image correspond to the positions of the 
transition metal atoms.
 Holding the image at an angle, one observes
that the lattice image shows no detectable phason strain  across
 nearly 15&nbsp;nm. Hence, the image is isomorphic to a perfect Penrose tiling.
The structure also
appears to be composed of overlapping, decagonal clusters.   
See Figure 4.
The HAADF image
shows that the innermost ring of atoms inside
 the clusters has neither pentagonal
nor decagonal symmetry. Rather, the structure breaks decagon symmetry
in precisely the same sense that the overlap rules (see the superposed
 kite-shape decorations on decagon tiles). Using convergent beam 
electron diffraction, the space group was determined to be
 centrosymmetric <I>P</I>10<SUB>5</SUB>/<I>mmc</I>  using convergent beam electron diffraction.

In Figure 3, the lattice image is superposed by a perfect single
decagon tiling. The perfect tiling overlay is shown in Figure 5.  
The correspondence appears near-perfect across the
image, with atomic decoration of each decagon and each kite-shape
decoration within the decagon appearing to be identical.
Jeong and Steinhardt have developed a simple calculational scheme for
relating the atomic decoration of the quasi-unit cell to the stoichiometry
and density.[<A
 HREF="node5.html#JS3">23</A>]
Figure 6 is a  candidate
 atomic decoration of the decagon unit cell that agrees with
current measurements: the stoichiometry, <I>Al<SUB>72</SUB>Ni<SUB>21</SUB>Co<SUB>7</SUB></I> ,
 and the density, 3.94 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP> ,

Implications</A>
</H1>
<P>
A new paradigm emerges  from
 recent mathematical  discoveries about Penrose tilings.[<A
 HREF="node5.html#Gum">15</A>,<A
 HREF="node5.html#JS">16</A>,<A
 HREF="node5.html#JS2">17</A>]
  The structure of
 perfect quasiperiodic tilings can be interpreted in terms of
a single quasi-unit cell  and matching rules can 
be replaced by simple energetics which favor the formation of 
some specific atom cluster.
<P>
In the new paradigm, the atomic structure of
a quasicrystal can be totally  characterized by 
the decoration of
a single cluster, rather than two clusters as the Penrose tiles would
suggest.  The result simplifies the problem of specifying and
of  determining the 
atomic structure since the only degrees of freedom are the atom
types and the atom positions within the quasi-unit cell.
Jeong and Steinhardt have shown that every  atomic decoration of the
conventional Penrose tiling can be reinterpreted in terms of an
atomic decoration of the quasi-unit cell, although the converse
is not true.[<A
 HREF="node5.html#JS3">23</A>]   Some decorations of the quasi-unit cell 
are not equivalent to decorating each obtuse tile identically and each
acute tile identically.
In this sense, the quasi-unit cell picture encompasses
more possibilities.
<P>
In the new paradigm, 
the atomic decoration of the quasi-unit cell  
encodes 
the  symmetry of the structure.
In the past, the symmetry of the structure has been determined
by appealing to reciprocal space (see Chapter 6 by Mermin in this volume)
or to perp-space (see Chapter 3 by Janot and de Boissieu in this volume). These indirect
techniques can be substituted by a a real-space description. That is,
there is 
a well-defined correspondence between the atomic
decoration of the quasi-unit cell in real space and the
space group symmetry of the structure.[<A
 HREF="node5.html#JS3">23</A>]
<P>
The new paradigm implies  a closer physical
relationship between quasicrystals
and crystals. Now it appears that both can be described in terms of
 the close-packing of a single cluster or unit cell.  In a crystal, the 
unit cell packs edge-to-edge with its neighbors.
Quasicrystals correspond to a
generalization in which the  quasi-unit cells
overlap.  In both cases, the formation of the particular
structure appears to be explained by 
a low-energy atomic cluster, although the atomic arrangement in the
case of quasicrystals is constrained to allow overlap. Hence, 
the new paradigm makes plausible 
why many materials form quasicrystals and, at the same time, explains
why quasicrystals are less common than crystals.
<P>
The new paradigm requires a  mechanism to explain how quasicrystals
grow. If the quasicrystals are grown slowly, then thermodynamic relaxation
to the ground state is possible. However, some of the most perfect 
quasicrystal samples,
including <I>AlNiCo</I> , are formed  by rapid quenching.
  In this volume, Socolar has described a scheme for solids
equivalent to Penrose patterns based on obtuse and acute rhombi
using 
vertex rules and stochastic growth similar to diffusion limited 
aggregation. This approach can be adapted to overlapping clusters.
 (Janot[<A
 HREF="node5.html#Janot2">13</A>] has already suggested a similar mechanism for
overlapping clusters, although his vertex rules allow random tilings
as well as perfect quasiperiodic tilings.)
If quasicrystals form due to a particular cluster being  energetically
favored, a simpler 
  kinematic
mechanism  may be through  local atomic
rearrangement  that increases the local density of the given atomic 
cluster.
<P>
The overlapping cluster picture may also account for other physical
properties of quasicrystals. Janot[<A
 HREF="node5.html#Janot3">14</A>]
has suggested that the cluster picture can naturally explain the 
inelastic neutron scattering properties,
and the electrical and thermal conductivity behavior. 
Finally,
the new paradigm suggests a natural explanation of why quasicrystals
form,
 shedding new light on an
old mystery.  In the new picture,
 the problem reduces to the behavior of small atom
clusters.  Perhaps total energy calculations based on a modest number of
atoms may be used to understand why quasicrystals form and 
to predict new ones.
<P>
From future structural
and kinematical studies of known quasicrystals, such as <I>AlNiCo</I> ,
 these principles may be
established  providing a new understanding of and new control
over the formation and structure of quasicrystals.
