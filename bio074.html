PUZZLE USING MOLECULAR GENETICS </h1>
<a href="Authors.html#Filson"><h3>R.P. FILSON</h3></a>

<b class=one>PREFACE</b><br>
ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY and Evolution is an activity about the evolution of three species 
of lizards on the Canary Islands. It is designed for high school biology students. Its purpose is 
to demonstrate to students that evolutionary problems are complex, and solutions may involve 
data from various disciplines of science. First, students must arrive at different phylogenetic 
solutions using only geographical and geological data. Then, students compare the 
morphology of the species involved, arriving at a more traditional solution to phylogeny. 
Finally, students deduce a phylogeny based on genetic distance using DNA sequences from 
cutting edge biotechnology.
<P>
The strength of the activity is its depth and interdisciplinary approach. This activity reinforces 
the interdisciplinary nature of modern science. Students utilize real data from real scientists. 
Students apply the principles of evolution in their reasoning to make use of this data from 
geology and biological science. This activity originated at <a href=http://www.princeton.edu/Home/>Princeton University</a> in the 
summer of 1995 while I was a participant in the Woodrow Wilson National Foundation 
Institute on Biology. Though now modified, it was written as part of a biology module on 
evolution called &#8220;Evolution: A Context for Biology.&#8221; My original intent was to write a 
similar activity on Galapagos Finches, but that proved to be too complex and DNA mapping 
data had yet to be published.
<P>
For purposes of this publication, I have placed the student activity in the beginning followed 
by teacher information and my discussion of possible solutions.

<H2>ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY AND EVOLUTION: SOLVING A PHYLOGENETIC 
PUZZLE WITH MOLECULAR GENETICS</H2>

<b class=one>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
Ever since <a href=/history/evolution.html>Charles Darwin</a> formulated his hypothesis on how the finches of the Galapagos 
Islands evolved into 13 species, islands have been a prime target for the study of evolution. 
By their very nature, islands are isolated and are essentially a living laboratory of evolution. 
In this investigation, you should be familiar with the terms speciation, geographic 
isolation, gene flow, gene pool, and reproductive isolation. You will work with real data from 
real populations. The data will include observations of lizard morphology (body form), 
geological age estimates of various islands in the Canary Island Archipelago, geographic 
distances, and genetic distances based on nucleotide base differences in DNA between 
different populations of lizards.<br>

<b>Background</b> &#151; Figure 1 (left) illustrates one of the many populations of lizards living on 
the Canary Islands. The Canary Islands form an archipelago of seven volcanic islands just 
west of the African continent (<a href="#MAP1">Map 1</a>). The island chain starts about 85 km (50 miles) west of 
the continent, following a fault line of the Atlas Mountains in northern Africa. Geologists 
theorize that a geologic hot spot of upwelling magma has been drifting westward for the past 
20 million years, gradually forming the islands as it moves. Thus the most eastern island, 
Lanzarote, is oldest, while the smaller western island, Hierro, is the youngest, about 0.8 
million years old. Volcanic islands are particularly good laboratories for evolutionary science 
because they can be dated accurately using radioactive isotope decay and because they start 
out as lifeless masses of rock emerging from the sea.
<P>
The development of ecosystems on volcanic islands is somewhat unpredictable. However, 
ecological succession does occur first with pioneer organisms that gradually alter the 
environment until a stable climax community is established. What is unpredictable is what 
plant and animal species will colonize these new environments. Much of this is left to 
climate, proximity to other land masses, and of course, chance. This investigation deals with 
three species of lizards of the genus <i>Gallotia</i>, and within one of these species, <i>Gallotia galloti</i>, 
four separate island populations. The arrival of the <i>Gallotia</i> lizards was probably by rafting 
(See <a href="#MAP1">Map 1</a>). Rafts of natural vegetation are often washed out to sea when high river levels 
cause river banks to collapse, carrying away both plants and clinging animals. Oceanic currents in this region
vary with the seasons. Colonization by airborne organisms, such as insects and birds, usually occurs during storms. 
In any case, there are some general principles of island colonization:
<P>
1) The closer the island to another land mass, the higher the probability of colonization. <br>
2) The older the island, the more likely it will be colonized. <br>
3) The larger the island, the more species are likely to be established. <br>
4) Geographic isolation reduces gene flow between populations. <br>
5) Over time, colonial populations become genetically divergent from their parent population 
due to natural selection, mutation, and/or genetic drift.<br>

<b>Problem</b> &#151; Evolution biologists have been faced with an interesting problem. What is 
the phylogenetic history of the three species and seven populations of <i>Gallotia</i> lizards on the 
Canary Islands? Does the presence of four morphologically different populations of <i>G. galloti</i> 
on the four westernmost islands (<a href="#MAP2">Map 2</a>) imply continuing evolution? In this investigation, 
you will use data from geography, geological history, morphology (body size), and molecular 
genetics to develop answers to these questions.
<P>

<H2><a name="PART1">PART I: PHYLOGENY BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE</a></H2>
<b>Procedure</b> &#151; Using <a href="#MAP1">Map 1</a> (download a <a href="images/filsonmap1.pdf">pdf version</a>), measure the distance in kilometers of each island to the 
mainland (Africa). List these distances on a separate page. Include the following 
islands: Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Tenerife, Gomera, Palma, and Hierro.<br>

1) Which island is most likely to have been colonized first and which last? Tell why you think 
so.
<P>
2) Using <a href="#MAP2">Map 2</a> (download a <a href="images/filsonmap2.pdf">pdf version</a>&#8212;includes Table 1 below) and your geographic reasoning, draw on a separate page a hypothetical 
phylogenetic (family) tree of the three species and the three additional populations of <i>G. 
galloti</i>. Your teacher will demonstrate how to draw a phylogenetic tree. Label your end 
branches with the following population names:<P>

Study the drawings from each lizard population in <a href="#FIG2">Figure 2</a> below (download a <a href="images/filsonfig2.pdf">pdf version</a>). Compare and contrast their body 
size with the distribution on <a href="#MAP2">Map 2</a>. To be sure differences were genetic, not environmental, 
researchers collected individuals from all island populations and bred and raised them in 
captivity. Their offspring still displayed differences according to their parental characteristics. 
Draw a new phylogeny chart based on morphological similarities and differences.
<P>
Compare your two phylogeny charts. Describe how they are different.

<H2><a name="PART4">PART IV: PHYLOGENY BASED ON MOLECULAR GENETICS</a></H2>
Recent studies by R.S. Thorpe (1993, 1994) have attempted to support various phylogenetic 
hypotheses by comparing genetic differences among the populations of the <i>Gallotia</i> lizards on 
the Canary Islands. The gene for cytochrome b, which is coded by DNA found in every cell&#8217;s 
mitochondria, was used in this study along with DNA from other genes. Cytochrome b is an 
important substance for cell metabolism and has probably been around since the first 
prokaryotes. Changes in its nucleotide base sequence (A, T, C, and G) that do not disrupt the 
gene&#8217;s function provide us with a kind of evolutionary clock. The rate of mutational changes 
due to pairing errors is relatively constant. The chances for such mutations are the same for 
any of these bases. This means that the more time, the more changes. When two populations are 
isolated and gene flow between them is restricted, the mutational differences accumulate over 
time. The longer the isolation the greater the difference.
<P>
Thorpe and his colleagues used restriction enzymes to cut the DNA, and gel electrophoresis to 
separate the fragments. Radioisotope tagging eventually led to the sequencing of the samples 
of DNA for each of the seven populations. Thorpe tested two populations on Tenerife to see 
if ecological differences were part of the story. He felt that because Tenerife is moist and lush 
in the north while arid and barren in the south, populations on that island might have some 
genetic differences. Also, he wondered if Tenerife was supplying colonizing lizards from two 
different directions. The results for Thorpe&#8217;s tests appear on the last two pages of this 
investigation.<br>
<img src="images/dot_red.gif"> <a href="#topfils" class=three>Return to top</a>
<P>
Your task is to count the differences between all pairings of the seven populations and use 
that data to construct a final phylogenetic tree based on genetic similarities and differences.
<P>
<b>Procedure</b> &#151; There are 21 different pair combinations possible using seven 
populations. You should work in a team of four. Each person will be responsible for counting all 
of the base differences for five of the 21 pairs (see chart below). The pairings are listed on <a href="#TAB2">Table 2</a> (download a <a href="images/filsontable2.pdf">pdf version</a>). 
Note that the first pairing has been counted for you. Record your results in <a href="#TAB2">Table 2</a>. When all 
teams are done, the data will be checked for agreement. The easiest way to make accurate counts is to 
cut the paper into four strips and tape them end to end in the correct order, A to D. You will then compare pairs 
of strips side by side to count the differences.
<P>
There are 21 possible pairings, each team member selects five pairings other than 1/2.

<H2>INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS</H2>
Use the data from <a href="#TAB2">Table 2</a> to guide you in redrawing your phylogenetic tree of the <i>Gallotia</i> 
lizards of the Canary Islands using both geographic and genetic information. Consider the two populations on Tenerife 
as a single population so that the phylogenetic tree contains six populations.
<p>
Low numbers express more genetic similarity and imply more 
recent common ancestry. Pairs with high numbers are said to have greater genetic 
distance between them. In other words, large numbers imply they are less genetically alike, have more distant ancestry, and have 
been separated longer. On a phylogenetic tree, early ancestry is expressed by low branches 
while more recently evolved are on the higher branches. Branches that are far apart imply greater genetic distance.<br>

1) In <a href="#TAB2">Table 2</a>, large numbers imply that pairs of populations are less related. Why 
is this? <br>
2) Among the six populations, there are three species. How many base pair differences is the minimum to 
separate any two species of these lizards? (Remember, don&#8217;t confuse populations with species.) 
Give an example to support your answer. <br>
3) Which two populations are most closely related? Justify your answer. <br>
4) Why should you expect the populations S. Tenerife (ST) and N. Tenerife (NT) to have 
fewer differences than other pairings? <br>
5) Which population is least related to the rest? Why do you say so?
<br>
Refer to your last phylogeny chart using genetic similarities and differences found in Table 2. 
Compare it to the phylogeny chart you drew based on the geographic distances and geologic 
age of the islands.
<br>
6) What difference is there between the two phylogenies? <br>
7) Which species, <i>G. stehlini</i> or <i>G. atlantica</i>, is the 
ancestor of the other? Explain your reasoning. <br>
8) Predict what is likely to happen to the four populations of <i>G. galloti</i> on the four westernmost 
islands. State what conditions will support this prediction.

<H2>TEACHER INFORMATION</H2>
<b>Target Group:</b> 9&#8211;12 college prep biology or honors biology
<br>
<b>Class Time:</b> Two days: first day, students can work independently, counting genetic 
differences can be assigned for homework; second day, student teams share data and the 
results should be discussed as a class. Can be extended over three days.
<br>
<b>Materials:</b> Scissors and tape; an atlas would be a desirable option.<br>
All figures, tables, and maps (except Figure 1) are available as downloadable pdf files:<br>
<a href="images/filsonmap1.pdf">Map 1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="images/filsonmap2.pdf">Map 2 and Table 1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="images/filsonfig2.pdf">Figure 2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="images/filsontable2.pdf">Table 2 (blank)</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="images/filson_phylog_solutions.pdf">Phylogeny solutions</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="images/filsontable2_completed.pdf">Table 2 (complete)</a>
<br>
<b>Overview:</b> This activity is a logic problem that is based on real organisms and real 
data. The problem is to develop phylogenies for seven related populations of lizards living on 
the Canary Islands. Three phylogenetic charts will be constructed, each using different forms 
of data: geography, geology, morphology, and molecular genetics.
<br>
<b>Prior Knowledge Needed:</b> This activity would be best used near the end of an evolution unit. 
Knowledge of the DNA code is needed and a basic understanding of biotechnologies such as 
gel electrophoresis, and DNA fingerprinting would be desirable. <i>Students must know the 
difference between a population and a species.</i> Students should be aware of the conditions of 
speciation including isolation, genetic divergence, and reproductive isolation.
<br>
<b>Teacher Instructions:</b> You may give this assignment out in pieces so as not to give  
students too much information on determining phylogenies. Students should not be given 
<a href="#FIG2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#MAP2">Map 2</a> until 
completing <a href="#PART1">Part I</a>. This could be done at home as homework. 
<a href="#PART4">Part IV</a> is the most difficult and 
most logistically demanding part of this investigation. Students will be comparing the DNA 
sequences for cytochrome b from seven populations. Only the first population has the 
complete sequence. All others listed below it have listed only what is different. However, each population 
must be compared with each other population. This makes for 21 pairings, a 
formidable task even for the teacher. The strategy is to share the work. All pairing 
combinations are given in the student instructions. Basically, students work in teams of four 
with each student counting differences for five pairings. Teams compare results to check for 
accuracy. Students need <i>not</i> cut the DNA sequences into seven separate strips. Creating one long 
strip from the four sections by taping end to end works well for students comparing the seven sequences.
<P>
The final activity will be to use the results from the pairings to compare the differences, and 
use this information to develop a final phylogeny chart. The 
solutions are provided below. The diagrams appear to be cladograms, but technically, they are not. 
Their similarity to cladograms is more related to their ease in drawing. The basic scheme is that 
low numbers of base pair differences 
imply closer evolutionary relationships. The phylogeny charts are intended to stimulate 
student thinking about the problems of understanding past and future evolution. There are 
many variations to phylogenies students can come up with, some better than others. The 
criteria should really be: can the solution be logically explained and justified. Only the last 
phylogeny based on both molecular genetics and biogeography has fewer variations and needs some serious 
discussion to close the subject. Finally, most questions on this assignment cannot be 
answered without student explanation. You should emphasize that answers may vary, but 
logic is required for all solutions.<br>
<img src="images/dot_red.gif"> <a href="#topfils" class=three>Return to top</a>
<P>
The information that follows is intended as a guide to solutions to the phylogenies based on 
different types of data. These are my interpretations and are by no means definitive.
<P>
<img src=images/FilsonFig7.gif width=309 height=224 vspace=7 hspace=7 align=left>
At left is one possible solution (download a <a href="filson_phylog_solutions.pdf">pdf version</a> of all three solutions pictured here) based on <b>geographical distance</b> and island hopping.  
It does not take into account actual currents which vary over time. There can be other reasonable solutions. The 
idea here is to get the student thinking about the logic of the problem, not its ultimate answer. 
Then numbers indicate the chronological sequence.
<br clear=all>
<img src=images/FilsonFig8.gif width=312 height=211 vspace=7 hspace=7 align=left>
At left is a possible solution using island <b>distribution and morphology</b>. In using body 
size, one is tempted to guess that medium lizards of Palma could have been the immediate 
ancestors to Gomera and the small lizards of Gomera are ancestors to the small lizards of 
Hierro. This could contradict the argument based on distance. Again, there is no one perfect 
answer. Ecologists and geneticists have debated several hypotheses for years. Numbers imply 
chronology.<br>
<img src="images/dot_red.gif"> <a href="#topfils" class=three>Return to top</a>
<br clear=all>
<img src=images/FilsonFig9.gif width=317 height=195 vspace=7 hspace=7 align=left>
The solution at left uses DNA evidence from <a href="#TAB3">Table 2</a> (completed table below&#8212; or download a <a href="filsontable2_completed.pdf">pdf version</a>) to deduce <b>genetic 
distance</b>. It is considered the most reliable criterion to establish evolutionary kinship. 
All base pairs have an equal chance for mutation and mutation rate 
is relatively constant, even though evolution rate is not. Note that north and south Tenerife 
populations are listed as one. Either may be a source for new colonization. The 
real surprise here is not the evolution of the smaller forms, it is that <i>stehlini</i> on 
Gran Canaria appears to have the oldest ancestry, although <i>atlantica</i> is actually closer to 
Africa. This unexpected surprise could support the hypothesis that the <i>Gallotia</i> lizard ancestor is European! 
As an extension, have students investigate the currents along the Portugal coast.

<dl>
<b class=one>ANSWERS TO INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS</b>
<dt>1) In <a href="#TAB3">Table 2</a>, large numbers imply that pairs of populations are less related. Why 
is this?</dt>
<dd>Large numbers imply distant ancestry because the longer two populations have been 
separated the more opportunity there has been for mutations.</dd>
<p>
<dt>2) Among the six populations, there are three species. How many base pair differences is the minimum to 
separate any two species of these lizards? (Remember, don&#8217;t confuse populations with species.) Give an 
example to support your answer.</dt>
<dd><i>G. galloti</i> on S. Tenerife has just 19 base pair differences from <i>G. atlantica</i>.</dd>
<p>
<dt>3) Which two populations are most closely related? Justify your answer.</dt>
<dd>The <i>G. galloti</i> populations on Gomera and Hierro must be the most closely related because there 
are just four base pairs that are different.</dd>
<p>
<dt>4) Why should you expect the populations S. Tenerife (ST) and N. Tenerife (NT) to have 
fewer differences than other pairings?</dt>
<dd>The S. Tenerife and N. Tenerife are just different populations on the same island, 
so I would expect some gene flow to occur, thus reducing differences between them.</dd>
<p>
<dt>5) Which population is least related to the rest? Why do you say so?</dt>
<dd><i>G. stehlini</i> is the population least related to the rest. The evidence is that <i>G. stehlini</i> had more genetic 
differences from all others, from 36 to 49!</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Refer to your last phylogeny chart using genetic similarities and differences found in Table 2. 
Compare it to the phylogeny chart you drew based on the geographic distances and geologic 
age of the islands.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>6) What difference is there between the two phylogenies?</dt>
<dd>The big difference is which population is oldest. The last phylogeny suggests <i>G. stehlini</i>, not <i>G. 
atlantica</i>, which is closest to Africa.</dd>
<p>
<dt>7) Which species, <i>G. stehlini</i> or <i>G. atlantica</i> is the 
ancestor of the other? Explain you reasoning.</dt>
<dd><i>G. stehlini</i> is the ancestor to <i>G. 
atlantica</i> because <i>stehlini</i> has more genetic differences from the others than <i>atlantica</i>. 
It is also possible that both came from Africa independently at different times or even from Europe.</dd>
<p>
<dt>8) Predict what is likely to happen to the gene pools of the four populations of <i>G. galloti</i> on the 
four westernmost islands. State what conditions will support this prediction.</dt>
<dd>I expect that each island 
population will continue to evolve to be a separate species because they are geographically 
isolated and mutations will continue to add up until they will become reproductively isolated 
as well.</dd>
