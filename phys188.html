<a name="1"></a>General relativity is a theory of gravitation and to understand the background to the theory we have to look at how theories of gravitation developed. <a href="../Mathematicians/Aristotle.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Aristotle',550,800); return false;">Aristotle</a>'s notion of the motion of bodies impeded understanding of gravitation for a long time. He believed that force could only be applied by contact; force at a distance being impossible, and a constant force was required to maintain a body in uniform motion.

<a name="9"></a>After receiving their definitive analytic form from <a href="../Mathematicians/Euler.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Euler',550,800); return false;">Euler</a>, <a href="../Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s axioms of motion were reworked by <a href="../Mathematicians/Lagrange.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Lagrange',550,800); return false;">Lagrange</a>, <a href="../Mathematicians/Hamilton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hamilton',550,800); return false;">Hamilton</a>, and <a href="../Mathematicians/Jacobi.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Jacobi',550,800); return false;">Jacobi</a> into very powerful and general methods, which employed new analytic quantities, such as potential, related to force but remote from everyday experience. <a href="../Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s universal gravitation was considered proved correct, thanks to the work of <a href="../Mathematicians/Clairaut.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Clairaut',550,800); return false;">Clairaut</a> and <a href="../Mathematicians/Laplace.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Laplace',550,800); return false;">Laplace</a>. <a href="../Mathematicians/Laplace.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Laplace',550,800); return false;">Laplace</a> looked at the stability of the solar system in <i>Trait&eacute; du M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste</i> in 1799. In fact the so-called three-body problem was extensively studied in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century and was not properly understood until much later. The study of the gravitational potential allowed variations in gravitation caused by irregularities in the shape of the earth to be studied both practically and theoretically. <a href="../Mathematicians/Poisson.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Poisson',550,800); return false;">Poisson</a> used the gravitational potential approach to give an equation which, unlike <a href="../Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s, could be solved under rather general conditions.
<p align=justify>
<a name="11"></a><a href="../Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s theory of gravitation was highly successful. There was little reason to question it except for one weakness which was to explain how each of the two bodies knew the other was there. Some profound remarks about gravitation were made by <a href="../Mathematicians/Maxwell.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Maxwell',550,800); return false;">Maxwell</a> in 1864. His major work <i>A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field</i> (1864) was written 
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>... to explain the electromagnetic action between distant bodies without assuming the existence of forces capable of acting directly at sensible distances. </i>
</blockquote><p align=justify>
At the end of the work <a href="../Mathematicians/Maxwell.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Maxwell',550,800); return false;">Maxwell</a> comments on gravitation.
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>After tracing to the action of the surrounding medium both the magnetic and the electric attractions and repulsions, and finding them to depend on the inverse square of the distance, we are naturally led to inquire whether the attraction of gravitation, which follows the same law of the distance, is not also traceable to the action of a surrounding medium. </i>
</blockquote><p align=justify>
However <a href="../Mathematicians/Maxwell.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Maxwell',550,800); return false;">Maxwell</a> notes that there is a paradox caused by the attraction of like bodies. The energy of the medium must be decreased by the presence of the bodies and <a href="../Mathematicians/Maxwell.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Maxwell',550,800); return false;">Maxwell</a> said
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>As I am unable to understand in what way a medium can possess such properties, I cannot go further in this direction in searching for the cause of gravitation. </i>
</blockquote><p align=justify>
<a name="23"></a>In 1900 <a href="../Mathematicians/Lorentz.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Lorentz',550,800); return false;">Lorentz</a> conjectured that gravitation could be attributed to actions which propagate with the velocity of light. <a href="../Mathematicians/Poincare.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Poincare',550,800); return false;">Poincar&eacute;</a>, in a paper in July 1905 (submitted days before <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s special relativity paper), suggested that all forces should transform according the <a href="../Mathematicians/Lorentz.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Lorentz',550,800); return false;">Lorentz</a> transformations. In this case he notes that <a href="../Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s law of gravitation is not valid and proposed gravitational waves which propagated with the velocity of light.
<p align=justify>
In 1907, two years after proposing the special theory of relativity, <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> was preparing a review of special relativity when he suddenly wondered how Newtonian gravitation would have to be modified to fit in with special relativity. At this point there occurred to <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>, described by him as the <i>happiest thought of my life ,</i> namely that an observer who is falling from the roof of a house experiences no gravitational field. He proposed the <i>Equivalence Principle</i> as a consequence:-
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>... we shall therefore assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and the corresponding acceleration of the reference frame. This assumption extends the principle of relativity to the case of uniformly accelerated motion of the reference frame. </i>
</blockquote><p align=justify>
After the major step of the equivalence principle in 1907, <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> published nothing further on gravitation until 1911. Then he realised that the bending of light in a gravitational field, which he knew in 1907 was a consequence of the equivalence principle, could be checked with astronomical observations. He had only thought in 1907 in terms of terrestrial observations where there seemed little chance of experimental verification. Also discussed at this time is the gravitational redshift, light leaving a massive body will be shifted towards the red by the energy loss of escaping the gravitational field.
<p align=justify>
<a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> published further papers on gravitation in 1912. In these he realised that the <a href="../Mathematicians/Lorentz.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Lorentz',550,800); return false;">Lorentz</a> transformations will not apply in this more general setting. <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> also realised that the gravitational field equations were bound to be non-linear and the equivalence principle appeared to only hold locally.
<p align=justify>
This work by <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> prompted others to produce gravitational theories. Work by Nordstr&ouml;m, Abraham and Mie was all a consequence of <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s, so far failed, attempts to find a satisfactory theory. However <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> realised his problems. 
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>If all accelerated systems are equivalent, then Euclidean geometry cannot hold in all of them.</i>
</blockquote><p align=justify>
<a name="38"></a><a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> then remembered that he had studied <a href="../Mathematicians/Gauss.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Gauss',550,800); return false;">Gauss</a>'s theory of surfaces as a student and suddenly realised that the foundations of geometry have physical significance. He consulted his friend <a href="../Mathematicians/Grossmann.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Grossmann',550,800); return false;">Grossmann</a> who was able to tell <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> of the important developments of <a href="../Mathematicians/Riemann.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Riemann',550,800); return false;">Riemann</a>, <a href="../Mathematicians/Ricci-Curbastro.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ricci-Curbastro',550,800); return false;">Ricci</a> (Ricci-Curbastro) and <a href="../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita',550,800); return false;">Levi-Civita</a>. <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> wrote
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>... in all my life I have not laboured nearly so hard, and I have become imbued with great respect for mathematics, the subtler part of which I had in my simple-mindedness regarded as pure luxury until now. </i>
</blockquote><p align=justify>
<a name="42"></a>In 1913 <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> and <a href="../Mathematicians/Grossmann.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Grossmann',550,800); return false;">Grossmann</a> published a joint paper where the tensor calculus of <a href="../Mathematicians/Ricci-Curbastro.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ricci-Curbastro',550,800); return false;">Ricci</a> and <a href="../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita',550,800); return false;">Levi-Civita</a> is employed to make further advances. <a href="../Mathematicians/Grossmann.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Grossmann',550,800); return false;">Grossmann</a> gave <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> the <a href="../Mathematicians/Riemann.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Riemann',550,800); return false;">Riemann</a>-<a href="../Mathematicians/Christoffel.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Christoffel',550,800); return false;">Christoffel</a> tensor which, together with the <a href="../Mathematicians/Ricci-Curbastro.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ricci-Curbastro',550,800); return false;">Ricci</a> tensor which can be derived from it, were to become the major tools in the future theory. Progress was being made in that gravitation was described for the first time by the metric tensor but still the theory was not right. When <a href="../Mathematicians/Planck.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Planck',550,800); return false;">Planck</a> visited <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> in 1913 and <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> told him the present state of his theories <a href="../Mathematicians/Planck.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Planck',550,800); return false;">Planck</a> said
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>As an older friend I must advise you against it for in the first place you will not succeed, and even if you succeed no one will believe you. </i>
</blockquote><p align=justify>
<a href="../Mathematicians/Planck.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Planck',550,800); return false;">Planck</a> was wrong, but only just, for when <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> was to succeed with his theory it was not readily accepted. It was the second half of 1915 that saw <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> finally put the theory in place. Before that however he had written a paper in October 1914 nearly half of which is a treatise on tensor analysis and differential geometry. This paper led to a correspondence between <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> and <a href="../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita',550,800); return false;">Levi-Civita</a> in which <a href="../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita',550,800); return false;">Levi-Civita</a> pointed out technical errors in <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s work on tensors. <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> was delighted to be able to exchange ideas with <a href="../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Levi-Civita',550,800); return false;">Levi-Civita</a> whom he found much more sympathetic to his ideas on relativity than his other colleagues.
<p align=justify>
<a name="48"></a>At the end of June 1915 <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> spent a week at G&ouml;ttingen where he lectured for six 2 hour sessions on his (incorrect) October 1914 version of general relativity. <a href="../Mathematicians/Hilbert.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hilbert',550,800); return false;">Hilbert</a> and <a href="../Mathematicians/Klein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Klein',550,800); return false;">Klein</a> attended his lectures and <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> commented after leaving G&ouml;ttingen
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>To my great joy, I succeeded in convincing <a href="../Mathematicians/Hilbert.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hilbert',550,800); return false;">Hilbert</a> and <a href="../Mathematicians/Klein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Klein',550,800); return false;">Klein</a> completely. </i>
</blockquote><p align=justify>
The final steps to the theory of general relativity were taken by <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> and <a href="../Mathematicians/Hilbert.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hilbert',550,800); return false;">Hilbert</a> at almost the same time. Both had recognised flaws in <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s October 1914 work and a correspondence between the two men took place in November 1915. How much they learnt from each other is hard to measure but the fact that they both discovered the same final form of the gravitational field equations within days of each other must indicate that their exchange of ideas was helpful.
<p align=justify>
<a name="54"></a>On the 18<sup>th</sup> November he made a discovery about which he wrote <i>For a few days I was beside myself with joyous excitement .</i> The problem involved the advance of the perihelion of the planet Mercury. <a href="../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Le_Verrier',550,800); return false;">Le Verrier</a>, in 1859, had noted that the perihelion (the point where the planet is closest to the sun) advanced by 38" per century more than could be accounted for from other causes. Many possible solutions were proposed, Venus was 10% heavier than was thought, there was another planet inside Mercury's orbit, the sun was more oblate than observed, Mercury had a moon and, really the only one not ruled out by experiment, that <a href="../Mathematicians/Newton.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Newton',550,800); return false;">Newton</a>'s inverse square law was incorrect. This last possibility would replace the 1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup> by 1/<i>d</i><sup><i>p</i></sup>, where <i>p</i> = 2+<i>&#949;</i> for some very small number <i>&#949;</i>. By 1882 the advance was more accurately known, 43'' per century. From 1911 <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> had realised the importance of astronomical observations to his theories and he had worked with <a href="../Mathematicians/Freundlich.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Freundlich',550,800); return false;">Freundlich</a> to make measurements of Mercury's orbit required to confirm the general theory of relativity. <a href="../Mathematicians/Freundlich.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Freundlich',550,800); return false;">Freundlich</a> confirmed 43" per century in a paper of 1913. <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> applied his theory of gravitation and discovered that the advance of 43" per century was exactly accounted for without any need to postulate invisible moons or any other special hypothesis. Of course <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s 18 November paper still does not have the correct field equations but this did not affect the particular calculation regarding Mercury. <a href="../Mathematicians/Freundlich.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Freundlich',550,800); return false;">Freundlich</a> attempted other tests of general relativity based on gravitational redshift, but they were inconclusive.
<p align=justify>
Also in the 18 November paper <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> discovered that the bending of light was out by a factor of 2 in his 1911 work, giving 1.74". In fact after many failed attempts (due to cloud, war, incompetence etc.) to measure the deflection, two British expeditions in 1919 were to confirm <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s prediction by obtaining 1.98" &#177; 0.30" and 1.61" &#177; 0.30".
<p align=justify>
On 25 November <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> submitted his paper <i>The field equations of gravitation</i> which give the correct field equations for general relativity. The calculation of bending of light and the advance of Mercury's perihelion remained as he had calculated it one week earlier.
<p align=justify>
<a name="60"></a>Five days before <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> submitted his 25 November paper <a href="../Mathematicians/Hilbert.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hilbert',550,800); return false;">Hilbert</a> had submitted a paper <i>The foundations of physics</i> which also contained the correct field equations for gravitation. <a href="../Mathematicians/Hilbert.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hilbert',550,800); return false;">Hilbert</a>'s paper contains some important contributions to relativity not found in <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s work. <a href="../Mathematicians/Hilbert.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hilbert',550,800); return false;">Hilbert</a> applied the variational principle to gravitation and attributed one of the main theorem's concerning identities that arise to <a href="../Mathematicians/Noether_Emmy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Noether_Emmy',550,800); return false;">Emmy Noether</a> who was in G&ouml;ttingen in 1915. No proof of the theorem is given. <a href="../Mathematicians/Hilbert.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Hilbert',550,800); return false;">Hilbert</a>'s paper contains the hope that his work will lead to the unification of gravitation and electromagnetism. 
<p align=justify>
<a name="62"></a>In fact <a href="../Mathematicians/Noether_Emmy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Noether_Emmy',550,800); return false;">Emmy Noether</a>'s theorem was published with a proof in 1918 in a paper which she wrote under her own name. This theorem has become a vital tool in theoretical physics. A special case of <a href="../Mathematicians/Noether_Emmy.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Noether_Emmy',550,800); return false;">Emmy Noether</a>'s theorem was written down by <a href="../Mathematicians/Weyl.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Weyl',550,800); return false;">Weyl</a> in 1917 when he derived from it identities which, it was later realised, had been independently discovered by <a href="../Mathematicians/Ricci-Curbastro.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ricci-Curbastro',550,800); return false;">Ricci</a> in 1889 and by <a href="../Mathematicians/Bianchi.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Bianchi',550,800); return false;">Bianchi</a> (a pupil of <a href="../Mathematicians/Klein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Klein',550,800); return false;">Klein</a>) in 1902.
<p align=justify>
<a name="64"></a>Immediately after <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s 1915 paper giving the correct field equations, Karl <a href="../Mathematicians/Schwarzschild.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Schwarzschild',550,800); return false;">Schwarzschild</a> found in 1916 a mathematical solution to the equations which corresponds to the gravitational field of a massive compact object. At the time this was purely theoretical work but, of course, work on neutron stars, pulsars and black holes relied entirely on <a href="../Mathematicians/Schwarzschild.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Schwarzschild',550,800); return false;">Schwarzschild</a>'s solutions and has made this part of the most important work going on in astronomy today.
<p align=justify>
<a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> had reached the final version of general relativity after a slow road with progress but many errors along the way. In December 1915 he said of himself

<a name="70"></a>Most of <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a>'s colleagues were at a loss to understand the quick succession of papers, each correcting, modifying and extending what had been done earlier. In December 1915 <a href="../Mathematicians/Ehrenfest.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ehrenfest',550,800); return false;">Ehrenfest</a> wrote to <a href="../Mathematicians/Lorentz.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Lorentz',550,800); return false;">Lorentz</a> referring to <i>the theory of November</i> 25, 1915. Ehrenfest and <a href="../Mathematicians/Lorentz.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Lorentz',550,800); return false;">Lorentz</a> corresponded about the general theory of relativity for two months as they tried to understand it. Eventually <a href="../Mathematicians/Lorentz.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Lorentz',550,800); return false;">Lorentz</a> understood the theory and wrote to <a href="../Mathematicians/Ehrenfest.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ehrenfest',550,800); return false;">Ehrenfest</a> saying <i>I have congratulated Einstein on his brilliant results .</i> <a href="../Mathematicians/Ehrenfest.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Ehrenfest',550,800); return false;">Ehrenfest</a> responded
<blockquote><p align=justify>
<i>Your remark "I have congratulated <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> on his brilliant results" has a similar meaning for me as when one Freemason recognises another by a secret sign. </i>

In March 1916 <a href="../Mathematicians/Einstein.html" onclick="javascript:win1('../Mathematicians/Einstein',550,800); return false;">Einstein</a> completed an article explaining general relativity in terms more easily understood. The article was well received and he then wrote another article on relativity which was widely read and went through over 20 printings.

Today relativity plays a role in many areas, cosmology, the big bang theory etc. and now has been checked by experiment to a high degree of accuracy.<br>
