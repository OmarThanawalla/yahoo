<HR>

 Below are the CLN "Theme Pages" that support the study of electricity and 

  magnetism. CLN's theme pages are collections of useful Internet educational 

  resources within a narrow curricular topic and contain links to two types of 

  information. Students and teachers will find curricular resources (information, 

  content...) to help them learn about this topic. In addition, there are links 

  to instructional materials (lesson plans), which will help teachers provide 

  instruction in this theme.

    and parallel electrical circuits to illustrate how electricity flows through 
    different types of basic circuits and to understand the practical applications 
    of these types of circuits. Students then apply their knowledge of electrical 
    circuits to the loss of power in the midst of July 1999's heat wave, determining 
    how electrical power systems fail in extreme heat, how "load shedding" is 
    used to reduce strain on power sources, and how power outages can be prevented 
    in the future." They use a New York Times article as a starting point for 
    their explorations.
