you've heard of it: a colorless, odorless liquid; a powerful coolant
and solvent; an easily- synthesized compound which is used by
industry, the military, commercial operations, and even private
individuals.</FONT></P>

we are talking about <B>hydrogen hydroxide</B>, also known as
<B>dihydrogen monoxide</B>, and we are here to tell you that what
you've heard about DHMO is probably not the whole truth. There are
forces out there, such as the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.circus.com/~nodhmo/" TARGET="_New"><FONT FACE="Verdana">Coalition
to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">,
who would seek to legislate its use and availability, placing heavy
limitations on it-- and eventually, eradicating it
entirely.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Verdana">I</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">n
the interest of fairness, we invite you to see their argument, and
then we urge you to return here, to learn the truth. Their subversive
agenda <B>must not be allowed to prevail</B>.</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana">

Hydrogen hydroxide is beneficial!</FONT></H3>

<DL>
   <DD><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It has been shown that hydrogen
   hydroxide enhances the functionality, growth, and health of many
   forms of life-- including humans!-- and current research suggests
   that it has become an integral part of our planet's ecological
   balance.</FONT></DD>

Hydrogen hydroxide is environmentally safe!</FONT></H3>

<DL>
   <DD><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Opponents of dihydrogen
   monoxide would have you believe that it is some kind of
   uber-toxin, that it wreaks caustic terror on anything it touches.
   This couldn't be farther from the truth; when handled properly, it
   enhances nature rather than destroys it, and even a worst-case
   scenario DHMO accident would be a trifle for the natural cycles of
   our world to handle.</FONT></DD>

Hydrogen hydroxide is benign!</FONT></H3>

<DL>
   <DD><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Coalition and others have
   popularized the label "dihydrogen monoxide" over the more
   chemically-accurate "hydrogen hydroxide" because they know how
   loaded the former name is. "Monoxide" has become synonymous with
   pollution, toxic gases, industrial waste-- and while hydrogen
   hydroxide is sometimes a factor in these problems facing our world
   today, it is rarely the dangerous element.</FONT></DD>

Hydrogen hydroxide occurs in nature!</FONT></H3>

<DL>
   <DD><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To hear its naysayers'
   descriptions, one would think hydrogen hydroxide was solely the
   product of industrial technology; that it came from years of
   research in clandestine labs. This is not the case! Hydrogen
   hydroxide has been a part of nature longer than we have; what
   gives us the right to eliminate it?</FONT></DD>
