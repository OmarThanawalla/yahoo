<hr><H2>Section Goals: </H2>  The Leukocyte Cell Biology Section (LCBS) studies differentiation and activation of
human and murine leukocytes and the role of the cellular immune system in mediating
antitumor immune responses.  The LCBS conducts studies on biological response
modification at the cellular and molecular levels.  One major focus of the LCBS is the study
of natural antitumor effector mechanisms and their regulation.  Specific projects involve the
study of a variety of stimuli-receptor responses with the focus on signal transduction with
a special emphasis on the effect of BRMs and receptor ligand interaction on intracellular
signaling events.  The LCBS is cloning NK receptor-like molecules, protein tyrosine kinases,
immunophilin related molecules and kinase substrates. A second focus involves  studies on monocyte/macrophage studies that  (1) investigates changes in intracellular biochemical events as well as the signals
and mechanisms involved in cellular activation; (2) conducts studies on the changes in
nuclear DNA binding proteins during the process of macrophage differentiation and
activation; (3) explores gene transfer approaches to utilize macrophages and/or macrophage products
for gene therapy of cancer and AIDS; (4) explores the ability of human moncytes to present tumor associated antigens and their potential use in a cancer vaccine setting.<P>
