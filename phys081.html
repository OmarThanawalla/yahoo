    The Sun is inducing gravity without a corresponding quantity of mass. This phenomenon is
    brought about by a plasma in a magnetically unified state; a magnetically sustained
    'non-space', an absolute vacuum held in place by the photospheric plasma shell.<br>

    Hydrogen/fusion core theories rest on the assumption that the mutual gravitational

    the Sun's mass to contract. This in turn creates the internal pressures which inaugurate
    nuclear fusion within the Sun's core.</b></p>

    <p><a name="c"></a><b>NON SPACE<br>
    Since this paper is chiefly concerned with the verification of gravitational induction,
    only a brief summarization of 'Non Space' will be presented here.<br>
    On a rudimentary level, non-space behavior can be compared to a vortex, which is a 'low
    energy' example of this phenomenon. Milk added to a <a href="presgrav1.html" name="pg">stirred
    cup of coffee</a> outlines a vortex, which consists of a high pressure exterior and a low
    pressure center. The vortex behaves in a manner identical to that of the planets orbiting
    the Sun, in that both phenomena obey Kepler's Second Law of Planetary Motion</b><a
    name="1r"></a><b>(<a href="#1">1</a>). Objects placed closer to the center of the vortex
    orbit at a greater speed than objects further out from the center, in accordance with
    Kepler's Laws. The depression in the center of the fluid is thus a relative absence of
    matter producing an effect characteristic of gravity.<br>
    No observable space in the universe is a vacuum.</b><a name="2r"></a><b>(<a href="#2">2</a>)
    It is notable that most dictionaries describe a vacuum as: &quot; A space devoid of
    matter.&quot; This definition is no longer sufficient description of a vacuum, since it
    appears that all known space contains some measure of mass/energy. Perhaps a more accurate
    description would be: &quot; A vacuum is a volume devoid of space.&quot;<br>
    Since a higher pressure attempts to nullify a lower pressure, a hypothetical volume of
    absolute vacuum (non-space) will attract space.</b></p>
    <p><b>Non-space is an absolute vacuum which induces gravity. This causes the exterior
    mass/energy space to gravitationally implode upon non-space. Any given volume of non-space
    has a temperature of absolute zero and is without time.<br>
    I believe that a magnetic field can exist in non-space, because it is a manifestation of mass/energy, but is not mass/energy in itself. In the following chapter I shall discuss
    how Non-space can be brought about by high energy plasmas in magnetically unified
    configurations.<br>
    <a href="#aa"><font size="1">Return</font></a></b></p>
    <p><a name="d"></a><b>PLASMA<br>
    To understand how non-space is possible, it is important to consider the rudiments of <a
    href="http://www-plasma.umd.edu./">plasma</a> behavior.<br>
    It was not long ago that physics classified matter into only three states: Solid, Liquid,
    and Gas.<br>
    Fairly recently (1960's) was it realized that a gas heated to a very high temperature does
    not obey the law of </b>gases<a name="pg2"></a><b>s; <a href="presgrav2.html">it displays
    a behavior unique to its own nature</a>.</b><a name="3r"></a><b>(<a href="#3">3</a>) So
    different is this state from a regular gas that it has been classified as a fourth state
    of matter: a plasma.</b><a name="4r"></a><b>(<a href="#4">4</a>)<br>
    Because all stars consist of this super-hot gas, a large portion of the known universe
    exists in a plasma state, a condition of matter that scientists have only recently begun
    to understand.</b><a name="5r"></a><b>(<a href="#5">5</a>)<br>
    Put simply, plasma is a super-hot gas in which electrons are stripped away from protons.
    When placed in the vicinity of a magnetic field, particles of like polarity interact with,
    and reinforce the field. The magnetic force is 1 X 10 to the 39times stronger than the
    gravitational force.</b><a name="6r"></a><b>(<a href="#6">6</a>)<br>
    The observation that plasmas align and reinforce magnetic fields is at odds with the
    fusion/core theories which rest on the assumption that the mutual gravitational attraction
    of the Sun's individual atoms override all other acting forces.<br>
    However, the Sun consists of super hot gas, a plasma. If the Sun's plasma particles
    mutually interact within a unifying magnetic field, then it is the Sun's magnetic field
    and its associated particles that dominate, not the gravitational contraction of the Sun's
    mass.<br>
    It occurs to me that the disparity between plasma behavior and the gravitational solar
    core theory is understandable; the fusion/core models originated before the nature of
    plasma configurations were understood.<br>
    Fusion/core <a href="plasmablame.html"> reasoning</a> was founded on classical gravitational arguments. These are
    incomplete and invalid in a plasma universe.</b></p>
    <p><b>The following discussion is a thumbnail rendition of how non-space can be possible
    in a plasma universe. However, the specific mechanism I propose here is rudimentary and
    speculative. It is not crucial to the overall concept:<br>
    Laboratory plasma configurations are truly astounding; they exhibit behavior bordering on
    the incredible.<br>
    Plasmas which are shot through a plasma gun ( a magnetic field ) and into a vacuum tube
    display well defined structures. Unfortunately, because of the speed (120 miles per
    second,) with which the plasma makes its way down the vacuum tube, photos reveal only a
    glimmering of the complexity that can be attributed to plasma structure.<br>
    Plasma structure can evolve into a helical flow composed of two separate streams, one
    consisting of electrons and the other of protons. The structure maintains a stable shape
    that can best be described as a cross between a smoke ring and a coiled spring turned in
    on itself.</b><a name="7r"></a><b>(<a href="#7">7</a>) When considering induced gravity,
    it is significant that electrons and protons can organize into separate camps, because
    like particles of the same charge repel one another.<br>
    It is my contention that when plasma particles of the same charge interact within a
    unified magnetic field, they fly apart leaving non- space in their wake. The 'nothing'
    left behind is a rip in the fabric of mass/energy/space and gravity is induced without a
    corresponding quantity of mass.<br>
    In this connection, it is interesting to note that the most advanced vacuum chambers
    employ ions - plasma electrons - to sweep the chamber clear of residual atmosphere.<br>
    Nonetheless, the comparison is crude; the best vacuum chambers can sustain a space fabric
    which is a 'foggy' 50,000 atoms per cubic centimeter, a far cry from an absolute vacuum.<br>

    <p><a name="e"></a><b>OBSERVATIONAL EVIDENCE<br>
    Neutrinos<br>
    1) Dr. Raymond Davis of the Brookhaven National Laboratory has been monitoring the
    emanation of neutrons from the Sun since 1967, and he has demonstrated that the flow of
    these neutrinos amounts to less than 1/3 of the amount anticipated by the current hydrogen
    fusion core theories.</b><a name="8r"></a><b>(<a href="#8">8</a>)<br>
    The deficiency in the neutrino count may be accounted for as follows.: Neutrinos originate
    from, or near, the Sun's surface. Since neither mass nor radiation can travel through the
    Sun's non-space interior, only the neutrinos produced on the side of the Sun facing us
    reach the Earth. Those neutrinos originating from the opposite side of the Sun cannot
    penetrate the Sun's non-space interior and so escape the Earth based observer.</b></p>
    <p><b>2) When sunspots occur on the Sun's photosphere, the neutrino count drops.<br>
    Neutrinos have little or no charge and so cannot be significantly affected by the magnetic
    field of sunspots on the Sun's surface. If neutrinos originate from the Sun's core and
    travel outwards, then sunspots on the photospheric surface should have no effect on the
    neutrinos. These subatomic particles should pass to the observer unimpeded, yet the
    neutrino count is diminished during sunspot activity.</b><a name="9r"></a><b>(<a href="#9">9</a>)<br>
    Why?<br>
    I suggest that neutrinos originate near the Sun's photospheric surface.<br>
    Within sunspots there is decreased temperature and luminosity. Consequently, there is less
    fusion and therefore a likelihood of a drop in neutrino production; hence a decrease of
    neutrinos during sunspot activity.</b></p>
    <p><b>Sunspots<br>
    Sunspots are depressions in the Sun's photospheric surface.</b><a name="10r"></a><b>(<a
    href="#10">10</a>) If the interior of a sunspot is closer to the Sun's supposedly active
    core, why does it get cooler and darker instead of hotter and brighter in these areas?<br>
    I suggest that the temperature and luminosity gradient drop with proximity to the
    non-space solar interior.</b></p>
    <p><b>Helioseismology<br>
    A whole new science has recently sprung up called Helioseismology. It can be observed that
    the Sun vibrates, rather like a bell. It is presently believed that solar resonances are
    propagated acoustically from the Sun's core.</b><a name="11r"></a><b>(<a href="#11">11</a>)<br>

    does not usually associate structures that get denser towards their center as good
    candidates for effective oscillators. Hollow structures, such as bells are good
    oscillators; so too is the plasma shell of a non-space Sun.<br>
    A core sun makes for an inefficient oscillator: how would solar oscillations travel from a
    violent nuclear core, up through a somewhat inhomogeneous body and still retain precise
    geometrical configurations by the time they reach the photosphere?<br>
    We know from studying the powerful magnetic fields that erupt from sunspot depressions,
    that the Sun is capable of propagating interior magnetic fields reaching thousands of
    gauss.</b><a name="12r"></a><b>(<a href="#12">12</a>)<br>
    I suggest that stable geometrical oscillations occur because the sun's interior magnetic
    field causes the Sun's exterior plasma shell to vibrate on its 'surface', like the
    oscillations produced by an acoustic speaker.<br>
    A blind-folded person would be hard pressed to tell whether he is being addressed directly
    or via a speaker. The same is true for Helioseismology; the observer is blind to the
    interior and so the information is interpreted in the light of present concepts of solar
    theory.</b></p>
    <p><b>Helioseismologists have discovered a condition in the Sun's shallower layers which
    is at variance with conventional core models: Through frequency splittings resulting from
    the Sun's rotation, it is observed that the rotation actually decreases with depth. It is
    hard for any core theory to come to terms with this lack of angular momentum.</b><a
    name="13r"></a><b>(<a href="#13">13</a>) However, this observation is in tune with a
    non-space sun; if the vacuum boundary upon which the photosphere rests has the strongest
    gravitational potential, layers directly below the photosphere would be even more
    constrained by the Sun's gravitational field and move slower.<br>

    Imagine a rotating gaseous giant, perhaps a little bigger than Jupiter. The gravitational
    sum of its mass causes intense pressure and so generates atomic fusion at its center. (
    Just like the conventional hydrogen/fusion core model.)<br>
    The fusion reaction is matter in a plasma state. Rotation creates a dynamo effect
    producing a magnetic field which unifies the plasma, which in turn strengthens the field.
    In this state, protons and electrons are forced into like camps, where they repel one
    another.<br>

    The solar hydrogen shell is under intense pressure at the vacuum boundary and this causes
    fusion reactions. This released energy maintains the plasma. Again, electrons are stripped

    <p><b>This concept is in harmony with the conservation of angular momentum, in that it
    accounts for the relatively slow rotation of our Sun.<br>
    Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, has by far the greatest portion of angular
    momentum of the Solar System.<br>
    If the Sun contracted from a cloud of hydrogen and essentially remained so ( as the core
    theories would have it,) then one would expect the center to rotate the fastest, just as a
    spinning ice skater will rotate faster if she draws her arms into her side. Yet the Sun
    completes only one rotation every 28-30 days. Jupiter rotates once in less than eight
    hours.<br>
    The non space scenario suggests that the early proto-Sun's spin was considerable while it
    was a dense ball of mass, but as it inaugurated nuclear fusion and expanded into a thin
    shell of plasma, it lost its angular momentum. Like an ice skater spreading her arms out

    <p><b><a href="pred.html">NEUTRINO RING EFFECT VERIFICATION</a><br>
    For this solar model to work, it requires that absolutely no mass nor radiation can travel
    through an absolute vacuum (non-space).<br>
    If the Sun's interior is impervious to neutrino penetration, it follows that any
    neutrinos issuing from the Sun can only come from the surrounding shell of matter.<br>
    Since neutrino production on that side of the Sun facing away from us does not penetrate
    the Sun, the observer sees only neutrinos from that half of the Solar disk which faces the
    observer.<br>
    Because of the Sun's spherical curvature, its horizon, or limb, would appear to be the
    source of highest neutrino production.<br>
    Thus, an observer capable of 'seeing' neutrinos, would look at the Sun and see a Ring
    Effect</b></p>
    <p><b>When neutrinos collide with atomic nuclei, the scattering pattern from the collision
    can determine the angle of neutrino approach.<br>
    It is therefore possible to determine the source of a given neutrino and distinguish it
    from other neutrinos. In this manner, it would be possible to build a neutrino
    'photograph' of the Sun.<br>
    This would be very desirable, because it would determine the source of solar energy
    production.</b></p>
    <p><b>If the majority of the neutrinos arrive from the core of the Sun, then the
    Hydrogen/Fusion/Core theories are on the right track.<br>
    This will not be so.<br>
    I predict that the Ring Effect along the lines I have described will be observed, because
    the Sun's energy production is exterior to the Sun.</b></p>
    <p><b>Feasibility of data gathering<br>
    We are entering an era of neutrino detector construction; USA, Russia, Italy, Japan and
    Australia have, or are in the process of building, neutrino detectors. <br>
    However, there is presently a problem with this approach. The angular size of the sun is about 1 degree.  The scattered electrons
    maintain the original neutrino directions only within about <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ex/9812011"> 25
    degrees</a> (<a href="#17">17</a>). So while the general direction of the sun is obvious, they cannot

    It remains to be seen if the <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9805135"> limit</a>
    (<a href="#18">18</a>) to discern solar neutrino origin is a technical  or a natural limitation.
    At this point (07/05/99) I do not know, but I shall update this paper should

    <p><a name="h"></a><b>CONCLUSION<br>
    This is the 1995 edition of this paper, the earliest version having been written in 1979.
    As new data has come to light and improvements for verification occur to me, I have gone
    about modifying and revising. Since the original, I have released five modifications of
    the paper to friends and acquaintances, this being the sixth. Throughout the revisions I
    have never veered from the original concept of the paper, namely that the interior of the
    Sun is non space, and that this non space induces gravity.<br>
    The chief change in this edition is the elimination of a somewhat more cumbersome means of
    verifying that the Sun has a non space interior replacing that abstract with what I
    believe to be a simpler and more eloquent &quot;Ring Effect&quot; observation.( p.8.)</b></p>
    <p><b>According to Dr. Anthony Peratt, who is involved in plasma research at the Los
    Alamos National Laboratory, Nobel Prize laureate <a
    href="http://www-plasma.umd.edu./alfven.html">Hannes Alfven</a> believes that gravity
    results when electromagnetic forces neutralize each other. Dr. Anthony Peratt also informs
    me that no one, to his knowledge, has pursued plasma/gravity experiments to date. It is my
    fervent hope that plasma physicists will perform plasma/gravity experiments in the near
    future.</b></p>
    <p><b>In the 'Suggested Reading' section, I make reference to H.E. Puthoff, who puts
    forward tantalizing evidence for the &quot;<a
    href="http://www-spires.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?k=EFFECT,CASIMIR">Casimir
    Effect</a>&quot;, a phenomenon where vacuum induces gravity.<br>
    I learned of H.E. Puthoff's papers and articles in 1990, and it is indeed striking ( and
    gratifying) to find ones own research paralleled.</b></p>
    <p><b>I suspect that most astrophysicists will initially be reluctant to accept the
    gravitationally inducing 'non space' concept and I can empathize with that skepticism and
    reluctance which researchers may feel when asked to embrace such a radical idea. Indeed,
    if I were reading a paper such as this written by someone else, I would probably have
    strong reservations myself.<br>
    Remember however, that the foundation of the non-space model does not rest upon
    speculation or conjecture; on the contrary, the hypothesis depends on specific, and
    achievable means of observational confirmation.</b></p>

    (15) That neutrinos can hypothetically pass through the Sun is confirmed in a conversation
    with Professor Wadehra from University of Michigan, dept. of Astrophysics (1/21/85).
    <a href="javascript:history.go(-1)"><font size="1">Return</font></a><br>
    Prof. Wadehra also agreed that it is possible to determine: (a) The source of a neutrino.
    The angle of neutrino approach can be determined by its collision with an atomic nucleus.
    <a href="javascript:history.go(-1)"><font size="1">Return</font></a><br>
    (b) A neutrino's energy level can be determined. (Hence a solar neutrino cannot be
    mistaken for a neutrino of a higher energy even though it originates from a nuclear event
    which is occulted by the Sun.) <a href="javascript:history.go(-1)"><font size="1">Return</font></a><br>
