    <p>For their <a

    Fullerenes</a></p>

    <p></p>
    <hr />
    The serendipitous discovery of a third allotropic form in 1985, uncovered a
    fundamentally different structure of closed carbon cages, which were to
    become known as <strong>fullerenes</strong>. This new family of non-planar
    carbon compounds has generated immense interest within the scientific
    community in such a short period of time, with thousands of papers
    published about fullerenes and fullerene-based materials to date.

    <p>In the early 1970's, the chemistry of unsaturated carbon configurations
    was studied by a group at the University of Sussex, led by <em>Harry
    Kroto</em> and <em>David Walton</em>. They developed methods for
    synthesising long chain <strong>polyynes</strong>, whose vibration-rotation
    dynamics were studied by microwave spectroscopy. They then used these
    observations for molecular radioastronomy. From 1975-78 they studied the
    long-chained <strong>polyynylcyanides</strong>,
    <strong>HC<sub>5</sub>N</strong>, <strong>HC<sub>7</sub>N</strong> and
    <strong>HC<sub>9</sub>N</strong>. These molecules were detected in the
    cloud material of the interstellar medium by radioastronomy. These
    molecules turned out to be produced by red giant stars.</p>

    <p>In the 1980's a technique was developed by <em>Richard Smalley</em> and
    <em>Bob Curl</em> at Rice University, Texas. They used laser vaporisation
    of a suitable target to produce clusters of atoms. Kroto realised that by
    using a graphite target, that the cluster apparatus would be ideal to probe
    the formation of carbon chains, and so planned a collaboration between his
    group at Sussex and the one at Rice.</p>

    <p>The Sussex/Rice experiment took place in September 1985. The technique
    probed the carbon plasma produced by the laser vaporisation by
    time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The experiments confirmed that large
    carbon chain/clusters were being formed. During the experiments it was
    noted that the peak for the C<sub>60</sub> molecule (and to a lesser extent
    C<sub>70</sub>) behaved unusually and formed under all conditions as well
    as exhibiting great stability.</p>

    <p>The experimental evidence, a strong peak at 720 amu (atomic mass units),
    indicated that a carbon molecule with sixty carbon atoms was forming, but
    provided little structural information. The research group concluded after
    reactivity experiments, that the most likely structure was a spheroidal
    molecule. Kroto mentioned Fuller's geodesic dome structures, which
    contained <strong>pentagons</strong> as well as <strong>hexagons</strong>.
    The idea was quickly rationalised as the basis of an icosohedral symmetry
    closed cage structure. The geodesic and electronic bonding factors in the
    structure accounted for the stability of the molecule, and it was named
    after <strong>Buckminster Fuller</strong>.</p>

    Beam-experiments conducted between 1985-90 provided more evidence for the
    stability of C<sub>60</sub> as well as supporting the closed cage
    structural theory and predicting some of the bulk properties such a
    molecule would have. Around this time, intense theoretical group theory
    activity also predicted that C60 should have only four IR active
    vibrational bands, on account of its icosohedral symmetry.

    <p>In 1989, the Heidelberg/Tuscon group, led by physicists <em>Wolfgang
    Kr&auml;tschmer</em> and <em>Donald Huffman</em> had observed unusual IR
    and UV features in thin carbon films produced by arc-processed graphite
    rods. Among other features, the IR spectra showed four discrete bands in
    close agreement to those proposed for C<sub>60</sub>. A paper published by
    the group in 1990 followed on from their thin film experiments, and
    detailed the extraction of a benzene soluble material from the
    arc-processed graphite. This extract was found to crystallise and X-ray
    analysis consistent with arrays of spherical C<sub>60</sub> molecules,
    approximately 7&Aring; in diameter. The C<sub>60</sub> molecule has two
    bond lengths - the 6:6 ring bonds can be considered "double bonds" and are
    shorter than the 6:5 bonds - see below - the "shorter bonds are coloured
    red for clarity:</p>

    Fullerenes are closed cage structures. Each carbon atom is bonded to three
    others and is <em>sp<sup>2</sup></em> hybridised. Hexagonal rings are
    present but pentagonal rings are required for the cage to close.

    <p>Mass spectrometry has been widely used to study the fullerenes. There is
    evidence for species as small as C<sub>20</sub><sup>+</sup>, as well as
    stable peaks for the cluster ions C<sub>2n</sub><sup>+</sup> (where
    2n&gt;32). Fullerenes which are stable or abundant enough to exist in
    macroscopic quantities have been studied further using a wide range of
    physical and spectroscopic methods.</p>

    <p>C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub> have similar properties, with six
    reversible, one electron reductions to C<sub>60</sub><sup>6-</sup> and
    C<sub>70</sub><sup>6-</sup> having been observed, whereas oxidation is
    irreversible. The first reduction for both fullerenes is ~1.0 V
    (Fc/Fc<sup>+</sup>), indicating they have electron accepting properties.
    C<sub>76</sub> exhibits both electron donor/acceptor properties.</p>

    <p>C<sub>60</sub> has a tendency of avoiding having double bonds within the
    pentagonal rings which makes electron delocalisation poor, and results in
    the fact that C<sub>60</sub> is not "<em>superaromatic</em>".
    C<sub>60</sub> behaves very much like an electron deficient alkene and
    readily reacts with electron rich species.</p>
