<TD><a href="alfarab.jpg">Abu Nasr Al-Farabi</a> (870-950) appears on the 1 Tenge note from Kazakhstan.   A scholar in many

					areas, including philosophy, linguistics, logic, and music.  He also wrote

					about the nature of science and argued for the existence of the vacuum (empty

					space).  For a brief bio

					<a href="birkel.jpg">Kristian Birkeland</a>

					(1867-1917) appears on the Norwegian 200 Kroner note.  Birkeland was a pioneer

					in studying the magnetic field of the earth and the aurora borealis.  He made

					the suggestion that the aurora were caused by charges emitted by the sun being

					guided into the earth's atmosphere by the earth's magnetic field.  An apparatus

					of his simulating this effect is shown on the bill at the left.  For a brief

					architects

					of the quantum theory, the basis of our understanding of the properties of

					matter.  He created the first

					quantized model of the atom (the Bohr model) and played a major role in

					developing the modern

					interpretation of the quantum theory. For a brief bio

					(1473-1543) appeared on the Polish 1000 Zloty note.  He was the first modern

					scientist to propose a model of the solar system in which the sun was at the

					center, circled by the planets moving in orbits, but not supported by any

					invisible crystal spheres.  He surpressed publication of his work until after

					his death.  To read a brief biography and to link to further sites about

					(1629-1695) appears on an out-of-date 25 guilder note from
					the Netherlands. Huygens was a contemporary of Newton's who
					made many important discoveries and inventions. As a result of improvements
					that he made to the telescope, he was the first to realize that Saturn had
					rings. (Galileo thought it was a "triple planet".)  He made the first pendulum
					closk, which substantially improved the accuracy of the measurement of time.
					His description of how waves propagate form the basis of modern wave theories.

					atomic structure --

					that most of the mass of the atom is contained in a very small bit in the

					center (the nucleus) and that

					the size of the atom is determined by very light particles -- the electrons.
