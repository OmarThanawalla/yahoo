<H3>Abstract
</H3>
This paper provides an extensive annotated bibliography of papers that have been written on 
quantum cryptography and related topics. 

<H3>1. Introduction
</H3>
For ages, mathematicians have searched for a system that would allow two people to exchange 
messages in perfect privacy. Quantum Cryptography was born in the early seventies when Stephen 
Wiesner wrote "Conjugate Coding", which unfortunately took more than ten years to see the light 
of print [1]. In the mean time, Charles H. Bennett (who knew of Wiesner's idea) and Gilles 
Brassard picked up the subject and brought it to fruition in a series of papers that culminated with 
the demonstration of an experimental prototype that established the technological feasibility of the 
concept [2]. Quantum cryptographic systems take advantage of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, 
according to which measuring a quantum system in general disturbs it and yields incomplete 
information about its state before the measurement. Eavesdropping on a quantum communication 
channel therefore causes an unavoidable disturbance, alerting the legitimate users. This yields a 
cryptographic system for the distribution of a secret random cryptographic key between two parties 
initially sharing no secret information that is secure against an eavesdropper having at her disposal 
unlimited computing power. Once this secret key is established, it can be used together with 
classical cryptographic techniques such as the one-time-pad to allow the parties to communicate 
meaningful information in absolute secrecy. 

<P>
In addition to key distribution, quantum techniques may also assist in the achievement of subtler 
cryptographic goals, important in the post-cold war world, such as protecting private information 
while it is being used to reach public decisions. Such techniques, pioneered by Claude Cr�peau [3, 
4], allow two people to compute an agreed-upon function f(x; y) on private inputs x and y when 
one person knows x, the other knows y, and neither is willing to disclose anything about their 
private input to the other, except for what follows logically from one's private input and the 
function's output. The classic example of such discreet decision making is the "dating problem", in 
which two people seek a way of making a date if and only if each likes the other, without 
disclosing any further information. For example, if Alice likes Bob but Bob doesn't like Alice, the 
date should be called off without Bob finding out that Alice likes him|on the other hand, it is 
logically unavoidable for Alice to learn that Bob doesn't like her, because if he did the date would 
be on. 

<P>
In the past few years, a remarkable surge of interest in the international scientific and industrial 
community has propelled quantum cryptography into mainstream computer science and physics. 
Furthermore, quantum cryptography is becoming increasingly practical at a fast pace. The first 
quantum key distribution prototype [2] worked over a distance of 32 centimetres in 1989. Two 
additional experimental demonstrations have been set up since, which work over significant lengths 
of optical fibre [13, 14]. 

<P>
The purpose of this work is to provide an extensive bibliography of most papers ever written on 
quantum cryptography, including some unpublished papers. In addition, a limited selection of key 
papers that describe techniques of crucial importance to quantum cryptography, such as privacy 
amplification [63, 73], is included. The papers are listed in chronological order within each section. 

<H3>2. The various uses of quantum physics for cryptography
</H3>
Quantum cryptography is best known for key distribution. The most complete paper written on the 
subject, which also describes the original prototype, is [2]. However, two applications of quantum 
physics to cryptography were discovered well before quantum key distribution: quantum bank 
notes are impossible to counterfeit and quantum multiplexing allows one party to send two 
messages to another party in a way that the receiver can obtain either message at his choice, but 
reading one destroys the other irreversibly [1]. (The notion of multiplexing was reinvented ten 
years later in the context of classical cryptography under the name of oblivious transfer, which will 
be used henceforth in this paper.) A more elaborate quantum oblivious transfer protocol was 
designed subsequently [3]. Another quantum cryptographic task that has been studied extensively 
is bit commitment [4]. Applications of bit commitment and oblivious transfer are mentioned in 
Section 9.

<H3>3. Alternative quantum key distribution protocols
</H3>
The original quantum key distribution protocol uses four different polarization states of single 
photons as carrier of quantum information [2], but other approaches have been put forward. Early 
variations were to use Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled pairs [5], to use only two nonorthogonal 
states rather than four [6], and to use phase modulation rather than polarization [6, 7]. A theoretical 
advantage of using entangled pairs is to allow the key to remain protected by the uncertainty 
principle even in storage, rather than merely in transit. More recent variations use rejected-data 
protocols [8, 9], photon pairs [10], and bright light [11].

<H3>4. Implementation
</H3>
At least three experimental apparatuses have been built for implementing quantum key distribution, 
in addition to the original 32 centimetre implementation [2]. A prototype built in Geneva follows the 
original protocol of [2]: it uses four different polarization states to carry the quantum information 
over more than one kilometre of optical fibre [14]. Another prototype built independently by British 
Telecom in association with the Defence Research Agency works by phase modulation over a 
distance of 10 kilometres of fibre; it is described in a sequence of two papers [12, 13]. Yet another 
experimental demonstration is in the works, which uses Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled pairs 
sent over kilometres of fibre [15].

<H3>5. Eavesdropping
</H3>
The key distribution protocol described in [2] has been proven secure regardless of the 
eavesdropper's computing power, but assuming some restrictions on the type of attack, such as 
requiring eavesdropping to be independent from one light pulse to another. More sophisticated 
attacks have been analysed in the papers quoted below, but none of them has yet presented a direct 
threat to quantum key distribution. Note that, contrary to all known quantum key distribution 
schemes, the quantum bit commitment protocol of [4] has been formally proven invulnerable to all 
attacks consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics.

<H3>9. Useful tools and related papers
</H3>
Raw quantum cryptography is useless in practice because limited eavesdropping may be 
undetectable, yet it may leak some information, and errors are to be expected even in the absence of 
eavesdropping. Also, we must protect against an eavesdropper who would impersonate Alice for 
Bob and Bob for Alice. For these reasons, quantum cryptography must be supplemented by 
classical tools such as privacy amplification [63, 73], error correction [71] and authentication [62]. 
Additional useful information-theoretic tools are provided in [70]. Quantum bit commitment [4] can 
be used to obtain zero-knowledge proofs [67] for arbitrary NP statements [68, 65]. Quantum 
oblivious transfer [3] can be used for discreet decision making [64, 66]. High-efficiency single-
photon detectors [72] are crucial for photon-based quantum cryptography. Quantum teleportation 
[69] may be useful to increase the distance for quantum key distribution. The Einstein-Podolsky-
Rosen effect is ubiquitous in quantum cryptography [61].

<H3>Acknowledgements
</H3>
I wish to thank Charles H. Bennett, Claude Cr�peau, Artur K. Ekert, Neil Gershenfeld, Simon J. 
D. Phoenix and Paul D. Townsend, who helped me put this bibliography together by supplying 
corrections, updates and additions to previous versions. I am also grateful to Ron Rivest, whose 
request for a quantum cryptography bibliography set me in motion for this work. Finally I am most 
grateful to the Rank Foundation and Artur K. Ekert for making possible the first international 
workshop on quantum cryptography, which was held in Broadway, England, in March 1993. That 
was a historical event for the field.
