<blockquote> <em>O</em>n the scale of hurricanes and large mid-latitude 
  storms, the Coriolis force causes the air to rotate around a low pressure center 
  in a cyclonic direction. Indeed, the term cyclonic not only means that the fluid 
  (air or water) rotates in the same direction as the underlying Earth, but also 
  that the rotation of the fluid is due to the rotation of the Earth. Thus, the 
  air flowing around a hurricane spins counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, 
  and clockwise in the southern hemisphere (as does the Earth, itself). In both 
  hemispheres, this rotation is deemed cyclonic. If the Earth did not rotate, 
  the air would flow directly in towards the low pressure center, but on a spinning 
  Earth, the Coriolis force causes that air to be deviated with the result that 
  it travels around the low pressure center.

<blockquote> <em>C</em>ompared to the rotations that one usually sees 
  (tires on a travelling automobile, a compact disc playing music, or a draining 
  sink), the rotation of the Earth is very small: only one rotation per day. The 
  water in a sink might make a rotation in a few seconds and so have a rotation 
  rate ten thousand times higher than that of the Earth. It should not be surprising, 
  therefore, to learn that the Coriolis force is orders of magnitude smaller than 
  any of the forces involved in these everyday spinning things. The Coriolis force 
  is so small, that it plays no role in determining the direction of rotation 
  of a draining sink anymore than it does the direction of a spinning CD. 
<br><br>
  <em>T</em>he direction of rotation of a draining sink is determined 
    by the way it was filled, or by vortices introduced while washing. The magnitude 
    of these rotations may be small, but they are nevertheless gargantuan by comparison 
    to the rotation of the Earth. I decided to include a picture of a draining 
    sink, and the first one I tried in my house was found to drain clockwise (the 
    opposite of what the silly assertions would have it do here in the northern 
    hemisphere). This direction was determined entirely by the way the tap filled 
    the sink. The direction of rotation of a draining toilet is determined by 
    the way the water just under the rim is squirted into the bowl when it is 
    flushed.<br>

<img src="../hand.gif" width="33" height="15" align="absmiddle"> 
  <em>Is it possible to detect the Earth&#146;s rotation in a draining sink?</em><br>

<blockquote>
  <em>Y</em>es, but it is very difficult. Because the Coriolis 
    force is so small, one must go to extraordinary lengths to detect it. But, 
    it has been done. You cannot use an ordinary sink for it lacks the requisite 
    circular symmetry: its oval shape and off-center drain render any results 
    suspect. Those who have succeeded used a smooth pan of about one meter in 
    diameter with a very small hole in the center. A stopper (which could be removed 
    from below so as to not introduce any spurious motion) blocked the hole while 
    the pan was being filled with water. The water was then allowed to sit undisturbed 
    for perhaps a week to let all of the motion die out which was introduced during 
    filling. Then, the stopper was removed (from below). Because the hole was 
    very small, the pan drained slowly indeed. This was necessary, because it 
    takes hours before the tiny Coriolis force could develop sufficient deviation 
    in the draining water for it to produce a circular flow. With these procedures, 
    it was found that the rotation was always cyclonic.<br>

<img src="../hand.gif" width="33" height="15" align="absmiddle"> 
  <em>Why do teachers claim that a draining sink reflects the rotation of the Earth?</em><br> 
<blockquote>
  <em>A</em> surprisingly large number of my undergraduate students 
    tell me that their high-school teachers told them that sinks drain in opposite 
    directions in the two hemispheres owing to the rotation of the Earth. Why 
    would a teacher offer such garbage to students when it is so easy to check. 
    A trip to the school washroom (let alone the ones at home) will reveal drainage 
    in both directions (which would certainly require the equator to assume a 
    tortuous track through the countryside). 
<br><br>
  <em>I</em>s knowledge just a bunch of abstractions to be memorized 
    with no recourse to the relevance of everyday experience? 
<br><br>
  <em>S</em>igh... I don&#146;t know why teachers do this. 
    I can but assume that those who do so just never feel any need to wash their 
    hands --- or their minds. <br>

    <em>Fakery of the first water</em> (so to speak). <br>
      <em>T</em>here are charlatans operating at a tourist trap in 
      Nanyuki, Kenya. In this little town, located right on the equator, a local 
      mountebank works for tips as he glibly cons busloads of tourists into believing 
      that the rotation of the Earth causes water draining from a container to 
      spin clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the southern 
      hemisphere. (Yes, you read that correctly, the charlatan fakes it backwards. 
      You would think that if he were going to sucker people, he would at least 
      get his directions the same as what really happens in large weather systems.) 
 <br><br>
    <em>T</em>his man&#146;s nonsense was captured (and endorsed) 
      by Michael Palin in one episode of his BBC TV special, <i>From Pole to Pole,

          This is the northern hemisphere (gesturing to his left), and this 
          is the southern hemisphere (gesturing to his right). If you drain a 
          sink when you&#146;re on the northern side of the equator, and you watch 
          the water as it drains, you will see that the water always rotates clockwise 
          [sic]. (Shot of a pan with water draining clockwise. Floating match 
          sticks are used to make the motion easier to see.) This phenomenon is 
          caused by the rotation of the Earth. The effect becomes stronger according 
          to how far you move to the north or to the south and becomes weaker 
          according to how close you go towards the line [the equator]. So that&#146;s 
          why we have to give some distance from the equator so that the rotation 
          can be noticeable.

    <em>B</em>ut, how is the fraud accomplished? The Coriolis force 
      is so tiny that it cannot cause the rotation in the faker&#146;s draining 
      pan; indeed at only ten meters to either side of the equator, it is so tiny 
      that it could influence neither the carefully performed experiment (described 
      above) nor the large scale motions of weather systems. 
<br><br>
    <em>S</em>o, the faker must be forcing the rotation by other 
      means, and by a sufficiently unobtrusive way that the busloads of tourists 
      do not spot the means. Indeed, a colleague of mine, who witnessed the performance 
      first hand and knew it was a cheat, was not able to spot how the fraud was 
      perpetrated. (It is an interesting sidelight that when back on the bus, 
      he informed his fellow tourists that they had just witnessed fakery --- 
      the Earth did not cause the rotation they had just seen --- there was widespread 
      disappointment. The tourists preferred the fantasy to the reality.) <br>

          <em>Non-circular pan</em> <br>

          The non-circular pan allows the faker to easily introduce rotation 
            into the pan after he begins. Let us imagine that the pan is filled 
            very carefully so that there is no rotation initially. Indeed, one 
            wants to be able to show the audience that any rotation introduced 
            while filling has died out. Now what? If the pan were circular, it 
            would be harder to start the water spinning by turning the pan itself, 
            but by having the pan nearly square, the water must turn if the pan 
            does.

           But how does one turn the pan without the audience becoming suspicious. 
            Obviously, it must be done in such a way that the audience does not

            enables them to see better.<br>

          You want two plastic containers: one which is to be the pan to be 
            drained, and the other is a bucket for the storage of water. The pan 
            should be non-circular. I found a quasi-square one (made by Sterilite) 
            for $1.28 in the local Wal-Mart. It is the three-cup size (.7 liter). 
            It works well. Drill a hole (say, 1/4 inch or 3/8 inch) through the 
            center bottom. You don&#146;t need a special stopper for the hole: 
            your finger placed underneath works just fine. The other container 
            can be any small plastic bucket with the only restriction that your 
            pan should be able to sit on top of it so that the bucket can catch 
            the water as it drains. <br>

            let the motion from filling die out. (You can insert and then gently 
            remove a vertical object, such as index card, into the water to dampen 
            the motion.) You can then show that there is little or no circulation 
            by floating a match stick (or sprinkling pepper) on the water. <br>
