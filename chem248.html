<FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>A philosophical stepchild</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Browsing a catalogue of
publications in philosophy of science one will notice that while
there exist some tens of thousands of contributions to philosophical
problems of physics and in later times also to philosophical problems
of biology, cognition science or psychology, the number of the
corresponding works devoted to chemistry makes up only a small
fraction of them. What are the reasons for this &#147;neglect of the
philosophy of chemistry&#148; that is still affecting the discourses
in the philosophy of science until our days in spite of an outburst
of activities in the last four years?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>One reason may be the
fact that the majority of chemists adore more or less some form of
scientific realism that ascribes the objects of chemical theories,
i.e. molecules, atoms, structures etc., the status of &#147;constituent
parts of the world&#148;. In introductions to chemical textbooks,
especially to older ones, there is often the claim repeated that
chemistry is one of &#150; or rather <I>the</I> &#150; oldest human
enterprise because all changes in the material world involve in one
way or an other chemical processes, making superfluous a
philosophical treatment of the &#147;obvious&#148;. On the other
hand, although two of the most influential modern philosophers of
science, Emile Meyerson and Gaston Bachelard, have been trained
chemists, it seems that in philosophical circles the view
predominates that chemistry does not provide the ground for the
flourishment of typically philosophical questions. This is perhaps so
because in contrast to physics and biology that &#150; with the
development of relativity theory, quantum mechanics, evolutionary
theory, and genetics &#150; trespassed the margins of human
imagination and shook the traditional views about the cosmos and
man&#146;s place in it, chemistry, during the historical period of
its maturing as a science, was not involved in answering any
cosmological, theological or existential questions but was rather
busy providing materials and methods for laying down the fundaments
of the wealth of some nations, improving the standard of living of
their populations and setting the seeds for the various environmental
and social problems their descendants are toiled with. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>There is also the claim,
that since chemical theories could or should be reduced to physical
ones, all philosophical questions connected with them can be
reformulated as questions of the philosophy of physics. An additional
argument against the existence of an autonomous philosophical concern
with chemistry is that this science lacks the dramatic turning points
or &#147;crises&#148; that have marked the development of physics in
the late 19<SUP>th</SUP> and early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Apart from the general
remark, that the conclusion that chemistry is not susceptible to
philosophical analysis is itself a philosophical statement, the
successful rebuttal of the other arguments against an autonomous
philosophy of chemistry depends to a great extent on the appropriate
definition of the aims and the methods of philosophy itself. In its
beginnings in the Greek Ionian antiquity, philosophy was trying to
give an explanation for the coming into existence of the world,
without recurring to theological or superstitious ideas. Later with
the Athenian sophists, their opponent Plato and his successor
Aristotle, philosophical efforts focused on the distinction of
&#147;truth&#148; from the &#147;apparently true&#148;, a problem
that was approached by various methods. However, the philosophical
discourses of the antiquity and the following fourteen centuries
remained confined into the boundaries of ontology, i.e. the
discussion about what is the object of knowledge.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Descartes marks the
first &#147;turn&#148; in philosophy towards the subject of
knowledge, the human intellect, and he also establishes its function
as a &#147;metascience&#148;, a science about science, by raising
questions like &#147;what can we know?&#148; and &#147;how it is
possible that a true knowledge is true for every intellect?&#148; He
is the starting point of the diverging ways that led to modern
idealism, transcendental philosophy, empiricism, positivism,
pragmatism and phenomenology, philosophical positions that
predominated the discourse in the three succeeding centuries. At the
end of the last and the beginnings of our century the second major
turn in philosophy occurred when first Frege and later &#150; more
thoroughly &#150; Wittgenstein showed that the solution of many
philosophical questions depends on the meaning of the words and on
their use. Since this &#147;linguistic turn&#148; we can restate more
precisely the somehow vague definition of philosophy as &laquo;the
rational, methodical, and systematic consideration of those topics
that are of greatest concern to man&raquo; by adding that this
consideration is focused on the languages that man uses in order to
communicate and orientate himself in those various topics.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>This brief and rough
sketch of the development of philosophy should not insinuate that
there is a linear advancement in &#147;philosophical knowledge&#148;
in the same sense as we think that there is a progress in our
particular technical or scientific capabilities. Although also modern
philosophers &#147;know&#148; more than their predecessors, the very
nature of philosophy as a discursive metascience hinders the
philosophical work of past philosophers from becoming obsolete. While
a two hundred year old science textbook is only of historical or
philosophical interest and his utility for modern empirical science
is very limited, a modern philosopher is always in position to review
critically the work of a long deceased colleague, to reinterpret it,
to gain some new insight from it, to comment on it, and finally to
arrive to a synthesis of new and old ideas. Thus philosophy has a
moment of &#147;time travel&#148; although the corresponding journeys
have a surprisingly low-tech demand on equipment.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Naturalism vs.
Culturalism</B></FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>This presentation of the
aims of modern philosophy is, however, still insufficient for the
elucidation of the question that was raised in the title of this
essay. For, the knowledge that knowledge itself depends on language,
and that science formulates statements using a special vocabulary
does not determine which kind of statements are the &#147;scientific&#148;
ones and which vocabulary is appropriate for a given science.
Moreover, depending on the function that is ascribed to language,
there are many possible ways to conduct philosophy of language and
hence linguistic philosophy of science. Thus within the tradition of
the nowadays predominant &#147;analytical philosophy of science&#148;
emerged at least two approaches that will be called here &#150; for
the sake of argument &#150; the &#145;naturalist&#146; and the
&#145;culturalist&#146; approach. Again this distinction does not
mean that we are dealing with two homogeneous, mutually feuding
&#147;schools&#148; of philosophical thought, but rather with two
wide and partially intersecting groups of various positions that
share some common traits.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Naturalism</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The central issue of the
&#145;naturalistic&#146; positions is that the sole authority for the
supply and the legitimisation of scientific terms and scientific
knowledge are the sciences themselves with their empirical methods.
Further, since most sciences define themselves as enterprises for the
exploration &#150; by means of observation &#150; and the description
of a particular region of the &#147;nature&#148; that surrounds us,
their languages have been also ascribed a descriptivist function. In
the various naturalistic idioms scientific statements describe facts
of the &#147;natural&#148; world that are thought to be accessible
independently from the cultural circumstances of the observers, the
scientific character of a statement being established by means of its
empirical confirmation. An other common trait of naturalistic
positions is their rejection of knowledge or of statements that are
valid <I>a priori</I>. This means that also the methodological rules
that govern empirical validations, i.e. rules for performing
experiments, conservation &#147;laws&#148;, logical axioms etc., are
supposed to be justified empirically, even if this is not evident
prima facie.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The role of philosophy
is on a naturalistic playground somehow limited: It can describe the
structures of scientific theories, analyse them for logical
consistency, elucidate semantic and pragmatic aspects of scientific
terms, but it cannot give &#150; since there is no place for it &#150;
any normative aid in cases of terminological ambivalence or in cases
where it is desirable to know in advance if a proposed statement is
worth to be put under experimental scrutiny or not. Apart from these
handicaps, the naturalistic approach encounters some additional
problems with far reaching implications: It has to accept for
instance a historically contingent scientific practice as the
normative frame that provides the criteria for the evaluation of the
scientific status of methods, theories, statements etc. This
procedure is, however, a version of the so called &#147;naturalistic
fallacy&#148;, i.e. the logically invalid derivation of normative
statements from descriptive ones. There is no reason that forces us
to accept a given description of a scientific method as compulsory
for other scientific enterprises. Further, since the entities &#150;
corpuscles, forces, fields etc. &#150; that occur in scientific
theories have been introduced in order to explain phenomena that had
been observed and reproduced <I>before</I> the invention of those
concepts, it is a <I>petitio principii</I> to regard the same
phenomena as a proof of the literal existence of these entities. An
example of this kind of fallacy is the widespread &#147;proof&#148;
of the existence of atoms or molecules from the &#147;fact&#148; that
the determination of Avogadro&#146;s constant by means of various
methods yields a reproducible numerical result. This argumentation
neglects the circumstance that both the concept of corpuscle (atom or
molecule) and Avogadro&#146;s law have bee invested in advance in
order to explain some chemical phenomena, and that the methods for
the determination of this constant as well as the interpretation of
their actually varying results as statistical fluctuations rely on
this successful explanation. By the way, the definition of the
objects of the sciences using concepts that have been introduced into
theories in order to <I>explain</I> the properties of these objects
or the phenomena that can be created with them, reveals a further
weakness of the naturalist approach. For, since the explanations
provided by the sciences are of empirical nature and thus prone to
falsification, the definition of the objects of the sciences by means
of these explanations is also susceptible to empirical revision.
However, the objects of the sciences &#150; e.g. bodies, stuffs,
organisms &#150; are also parts of pre-scientific situations and they
have to be identified also by non-scientists. If this were not so,
then scientific knowledge would not have any value beyond the
boundaries of the research laboratory. With other words, there must
be a method of identifying the objects of the sciences in such a
manner that enables the communication between non-scientists and
scientists before the latter begin with any research.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>A further problem of the
various naturalistic approaches is, that by abolishing the
distinction between the &#147;natural&#148; and the &#147;artificial&#148;
they also make the concept of nature itself void of any sense. On the
level of moral considerations this blur has the unpleasant
consequence of relieving man from the responsibility for the results
of his actions, dooming him either to fatalism or to intellectual and
practical inactivity.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In the course of the
development of modern philosophy of science there have been some
efforts to repair the problems of naturalism without giving up the
programme as a whole. This has been done either by taking a more or
less ad-hoc attitude towards the methodological rules of the sciences
or by stressing the fact that sciences are sociohistorical phenomena
depending on their past evolution and on the structure of the
cultures they are embedded in. Ad-hoc positions have been either
failed to achieve their targets like the efforts Carnap&#146;s in his
&#147;Logical construction of the world&#148; or they have been
regarded as dogmatic both from scientists and from philosophers of
science like Popper&#146;s &#147;Logic of scientific discovery&#148;,
because they could not justify the methodological rules they
introduced. The reaction was the upcoming of the mentioned
sociohistorical approaches like Kuhn&#146;s
paradigm-change-epistemology, the social constructivism, or the newly
launched &#147;historical epistemology&#148;. Although all these
positions offer important insights in the process of science, they
share the flaw of being prone to the naturalistic fallacy because
they try to derive normative issues from the descriptive analysis of
the historical development or the social structure of science.
Additionally they must also justify the use of the particular
historical or sociological methods they apply and also ensure the
validity of their results. Thus the problem of normativity in science
is not resolved by them, but only shifted to the next level, where
the carrousel begins again.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>However, the emphasis on
historical and social issues of science marks the transition to the
culturalistic attitude against science, an attitude that establishes
in advance a distinction between a <I>cultural</I> and a <I>natural</I>
aspect of the world. The cultural aspect embraces all things,
situations and processes that exist, take place or are initiated as a
result of aim-guided actions of mankind in its various cultural
contexts, while the natural aspect applies on those incidents that
although not man-made, we are nevertheless forced to &#147;endure&#148;
or to &#147;observe&#148; in order to achieve our aims. The cultural
aspects of a bronze statue for example are the religious, aesthetical
or perhaps political reasons that led to the decision for producing
such an artefact, the actions for the carving of its form that are
performed as part of a traditional practice of sculpturing, or the
price of the material. The natural aspects are the fact that the
statue material has to be produced by a given procedure from given
raw materials, that in order to cast it, one has to heat it to a
given temperature that cannot be altered by mere decision of the
caster, the fact, that the statue under certain weather conditions
will be covered by patina, that it conducts electricity and so forth.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Culturalism</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The culturalist approach
regards science as a man-made process serving the achievement of aims
that are formulated in cultural contexts. The problem a culturalist
philosophy of science has to solve, is then, how can science provide
mankind with universally applicable answers if the questions are
formulated in partially or totally incommensurable cultural
environments, without taking into account a &#147;natural connex&#148;
that trespasses cultural boundaries. Some variants of culturalistic
philosophy just accept this situation an give up any attempt for a
transcultural foundation of science. The very fact, however, that
there is such a communication and that this communication is a
desired one &#150; even if this desire is neglected among some
cultural contexts for various reasons &#150; suggests, that there
must be a method for establishing a consensus about scientific issues
that transcends individual, social and cultural limits. Our
suggestion is, that the transsubjective and transcultural
establishing of the meaning of scientific terms can be done by
recurring to actions that are needed for the achievement of aims in
manufacturing (&#147;poietical&#148;) practices that are part of the
everyday life in its various cultural contexts. All these practices,
their elements and the knowledge that has been accumulated therein,
are insofar primordial in respect to scientific theories, because
they are experienced by both individuals and communities as being the
&#147;background of everyday activity&#148;, and because there is no
need of any scientific knowledge in order to become a part of them.
The poietical practices constitute in each cultural context an area
of practical experience that can be learnt by a novice by following
the master&#146;s instructions, or by repeating its actions.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Albeit culturally
embedded, it is nevertheless possible to categorise the various
poietical practices according to aspects that are common to them. It
is the task of the sciences to provide theoretical knowledge about
these &#147;common aspects&#148; of poietical practices, and it is
the task of philosophy of science to find a method for the
constitution of these aspects that can be transculturally accepted,
and to elaborate the tools for the evaluation of scientific knowledge
for its transcultural utility.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Summarising, we can
formulate the task of such a philosophy of science as the rendering
possible a transcultural &#147;commitment without dogma&#148; to the
fundamental issues of the sciences by a step-to-step &#147;methodical&#148;
reconstruction of their vocabulary and their theories, recurring to
the actions involved in the achievement of their aims.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H1 STYLE="page-break-after: avoid"><A NAME="Ch3"></A><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Philosophy&#146;s
offer to Chemistry</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>This outline of a
&#147;methodical culturalist&#148; approach to the philosophy of
science enables the definitive rebuttal of the claims that chemistry
is a philosophy-barren land. Namely, in the everyday life there exist
a lot of poietical practices in which altering of the &#147;stuff&#148;
composition of things plays a more or less central role, either in
the process of the fabrication of a thing, or as an aim of the
practice itself. Especially in the latter ones &#150; the so-called
&#147;stuff producing and processing practices&#148;, methods and
procedures are deployed that are independent from the methods of
other practices, creating the demand for a science that is devoted to
their theoretical sustainment &#150; chemistry. Thus the general
philosophical question about the constitution of the objects of the
sciences can and shall also be stated for the special case of
chemistry. On the other hand, since at the pre-scientific level the
objects and the methods of the stuff producing and processing
practices are independent from others, the objects and methods of
chemistry are also independent from those of the other sciences,
especially physics and biology. This statement does not deny the
possibility of introducing physical and biological methods in
chemistry &#150; something that belongs to the present
state-of-the-art of this science &#150;, but it sets up a methodical
order or methodical relationship between chemical, physical and
biological methods, namely that the chemical methods are the ultimate
standard for the evaluation of the utility of any other method for
the resolution of chemical problems.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>A further argument for
an autonomous philosophy of chemistry is the fact that chemists label
some chemical sentences with expressions such as &#147;law&#148;,
&#147;principle&#148;, &#147;theory&#148; or &#147;rule&#148;. These
expressions, however, are not chemical ones, but belong to a
metatheoretical level, i.e. to the level of the speaking <I>about</I>
chemistry. Their use in chemistry has to be justified according to
criteria that have to be established separately in a philosophical
discourse. And finally, the fact the chemistry has been preserved &#150;
at least in the last hundred and fifty years &#150; from being
involved in the ideological struggle between religion and science
renders it in the position of being a &#147;neutral&#148; test and
demonstration field for the &#147;conclusions&#148; of philosophy of
science.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In the light of these
arguments, the offer philosophy can make to chemistry is the
elucidation of the provenance of the objects and the methods of
chemistry as a cultural achievement by means of a methodical
reconstruction of its language and its norms. For chemistry this is a
bargain, because in our times the question about the constitution and
the normative frame of this science has been &#150; for good reasons
&#150; removed from the focus of the chemists, but problems connected
herewith remain virulent and come to the surface every time when
issues like the validity and the reliability of chemical analyses, or
the relationship between function and structure of biomolecules, or
the fail of chemical procedures during the transition from laboratory
to technical scale, or conceptual problems like aromaticity are
discussed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Besides those &#147;core
effects&#148;, a methodical reconstruction of chemistry would have
also an impact on didactic of chemistry rendering the learning and
the teaching of chemistry more feasible, would enable a better
understanding of its history and would also help settle controversies
in matters of science ethics and scientists&#146; responsibility.</FONT></FONT></P>

</UL>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Even if the most primary
level textbooks begin with the introduction of basic chemical terms
recurring to activities of everyday life, atoms and molecules are
&#147;discovered&#148; very soon, in order to provide the
&#147;explanation&#148; of the phenomena. The situation worsens
dramatically in chemistry textbooks of the secondary and the college
level, where the importance of theoretical concepts like &#147;atoms&#148;,
&#147;molecules&#148;, &#147;chemical bond&#148; and &#147;structure&#148;
in modern chemistry has led many authors to an entirely axiomatic
arrangement of their textbooks, setting those concepts at the
beginning of the presentation of chemistry and not at the end, where
they methodically belong in their function as explaining instances.
Thus didactic of chemistry reproduces and transmits the naturalistic
misunderstandings and misconceptions, relying on the authority of the
teacher in order to ensure their acceptance by the pupils. In
contrary, the methodically reconstructed chemistry begins with the
familiar world of everyday life and introduces the specific chemical
terms operatively, i.e. by creating the situation that is described
by the given term, justifying at every step their relevance and
adequacy. Thus the structure of the chemical theory becomes
transparent and comprehensible.</FONT></FONT></P>

</UL>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Chemistry as a cultural
achievement for the theoretical sustainment of stuff producing and
processing practices has its own cultural history in the course of
which it gained its modern contours. It is undeniable that the
current chemico-historiographical research has made many invaluable
contributions to the understanding of the various social,
institutional, personal, political and also theoretical aspects that
led to the raise of this science and determined later its further
development, history of chemistry being admittedly one of the most
proliferative branches of history of science. However, there is no
profit without investment. Thus the success of modern chemical
historiography relies on the existence of a &#147;tacit&#148;
methodical &#147;ground&#148; that provides it with the &#147;guidelines&#148;
for the interpretation of the chemical work of the past generations.
Theoretical shortcomings that arise from these intuitively made
&#147;tacit assumptions&#148; become visible, however, when
historians of chemistry begin to reflect upon their own activity.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The results of a
methodical reconstruction of chemistry can be utilised for the set up
of a chemical historiography that seeks to elucidate the
circumstances for the upcoming of chemistry as an autonomous science,
and to work out the structures of the arguments the past chemists
used for the justification of their terminological distinctions and
their of theoretical conclusions, uncovering hidden methodical
&#147;ruptures&#148;, argumentative circularities, anachronisms and
&#147;prothystera&#148;. Central concern of a chemical historiography
on a methodical and culturalistic basis would be the spatial and
temporal determination of the genesis of the practically oriented
chemist &#150; in contrast to the natural philosopher of the
antiquity and the medieval scholar &#150; in the vicinity of the
&#147;chemical handicrafts&#148;, working out the cultural conditions
that enabled its appearance on the stage of history, and the adjacent
exploration of the history of chemical ideas, concepts, institutions
and of the various interconnections between society and chemistry.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>A plethora of undesired
environmental, social and political side effects and consequences of
the explosive development of chemistry in the last fifty years kicked
off an even increasing discussion on the ethical limits of chemical
enterprise and on the responsibility of the chemists for the taming
of the forces they have freed from their retorts. The importance of
philosophy of chemistry for a fruitful discourse on these topics is
easily illustrated on following example:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>If a chemist sees
himself in a naturalistic manner as a mere &#147;discoverer&#148; of
the secrets of nature, like a miner who follows his vein in the earth
not being able to influence its direction and yield, then, in the
case he becomes aware that the knowledge he provides is more harmful
than useful for mankind, he has no other choice than to cease his
research activities on the particular field &#150; to give up the
mine. But with a culturalistic understanding of his activity as the
production of knowledge for the solution of well defined problems, he
is placed in a position that enables him to adjust himself to the
upcoming conflicts and to search for a solution together with the
people that are affected by his results.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H1><A NAME="Ch4"></A><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>A
glimpse in the method</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The methodical
reconstruction of the language of chemistry on a culturalistic basis
consists of two main steps. First, the circle of those everyday life
poietical practices has to be specified, that can provide the
objects, the methods and the apparatus for the beginning of
scientific activity, and that can gain a profit from the theoretical
sustainment by chemistry. Such practices are handicrafts like
metallurgy, tannery, pharmacopoeia, food-processing, charcoal
burning, and industries like the petroleum refineries, the plants for
the fabrication of dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals or plastics. They all
share the common trait of being &#147;stuff producing and processing&#148;
practices, involving methods like prospecting, mixing and separating,
transforming or fermenting &#147;stuffs&#148; using various apparatus
reactors, retorts, distillation apparatus, grinders, centrifuges and
so on. The circle of practices that possess some of these traits
makes up the so called <I>lifeworldly basis</I> of chemistry.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The second &#150; more
complicated &#150; step includes a) the determination of the semantic
function of the chemically relevant terms and their redefinition in
such a manner that their meaning can be transsubjectively and
transculturally ensured, and b) the formulation of norms for the
performance of chemical actions, that enable the reproducibility of
the relevant procedures and the comparability of their results in
respect to the formulation of &#147;chemical laws&#148; and to the
establishing of a systematic genealogy among the stuffs.</FONT></FONT></P>

transsubjective and transcultural meaning of the chemical terms is
accomplished by observing the so called &#147;principle of methodical
order&#148;, i.e. the prescription, that the linguistic definition of
a term shall describe precisely the order of the actions that are
needed in order to create the situation that the term under
definition is referring to. The methodical order of the words has to
follow the pragmatical order of the actions.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>b) Semantic functions</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In a typical scientific
statement like &#132;<I>Measurements with the x-ray spectrometer
revealed that the structure of the naphthalene molecules is that of
two condensed benzene rings</I>&#148; not every word fulfils the same
purpose and not every word is introduced in the same manner when a
novice learns the language of a particular science. For our purposes
we will not concern ourselves with words that occur in every sentence
of our daily language &#150; like &#145;with&#146;, &#145;that&#146;,
&#145;is&#146; although they are very promising objects for
philosophical reasoning &#150;, but we will draw our attention on
words of special interest to a natural scientist, like &#145;measurement&#146;,
&#145;naphthalene&#146; and &#145;molecule&#146;.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The meaning of words
like &#145;measurement&#146;, &#145;condensed&#146;, and &#145;x-ray
spectrometer&#146; for example is revealed to the freshman students
of chemistry by example and counterexample. The teacher shows them
which action is called &#145;measurement&#146; or &#145;to measure&#146;,
which apparatus is called &#145;x-ray spectrometer&#146;, which
process is called &#145;condensation&#146; or &#145;to condense&#146;,
and controls the success of his effort by requesting them to perform
the desired action, to name the apparatus or to describe the process.
Those words that are used in order to distinguish and to describe
actions, things, situations and processes have the semantic function
of <I>predicators</I>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>If we turn now our
attention to the manner in which words like &#145;stuff&#146;,
&#145;structure&#146;, or &#145;naphthalene&#146; are introduced, we
will notice that it is not possible to establish their meanings
ostentatively or imperatively. It is not possible to establish the
meaning of the word &#145;water&#146; solely by pointing to a pond
and pronouncing &#147;water&#148;. What we see are liquid things
called &#145;pond&#146;, &#145;river&#146;, &#145;drop&#146;, &#145;the
ocean&#146;, but not water. On the other hand, sentences that contain
similar words are not at all meaningless. From these examples we can
see that there are words without reference in the above mentioned
sense. Nevertheless, they have a meaning that is established by
talking <I>about</I> things.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>As second step in the
reconstruction of the term &#145;stuff&#146; and the stuff words we
undertake a reformulation: Instead of saying &#147;there is a chair
made of wood&#148; we can also say &#147;there is a wooden chair&#148;.
Similarly we can substitute every stuff-noun by an appropriate
stuff-adjective &#150; although this is not common in contemporary
English &#150;, and still retain the original meaning of this
sentence. Such <I>appredicators</I> are words that are used for the
classification of things, i.e. they cannot be used alone-standing in
a predicative sentence, although they refer in general to something,
namely to properties of things. Again the reference problem arises
here: Albeit appredicators like &#145;red&#146;, &#145;rapid&#146;,
&#145;heavy&#146; can be introduced ostentatively or imperatively,
and hence posses a reference, this is not the case for our stuff
adjectives. It is not a single referable property, but merely a
property of a property that makes a thing wooden or &#145;coppern&#146;,
namely the property of being <I>homogeneous</I> in respect to a
number of properties. Being homogeneous means here that randomly cut
parts of a thing match in a specific kind of properties. These
properties that share the feature that a thing can be homogenised or
be regarded as homogeneous in respect to them are its <I>substantial</I>
properties. Examples for such properties are aggregate state (solid,
liquid, gaseous), colour, taste, smell, the ability to give a sound
when struck, hardness, density, inflammability, electrical
conductivity, refractive index etc. Examples of non-substantial
properties are shape, weight, velocity, or temperature. Things that
are homogenised or regarded as homogeneous in respect to their
aggregate state and to one of the other substantial properties are
<I>substantially homogeneous</I>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The final conceptual
step from substantially homogeneous things to the talking about the
stuff they are made of, is done by establishing an equivalence
relation between substantially homogeneous things, the relation of
being <I>equisubstantial</I> (this is the case when two substantially
homogeneous things match in their aggregate status and in one or more
other substantial properties), and by introducing an expression &#150;
&#145;stuff&#146; or its synonym &#145;substance&#146; &#150; that
denotes this relationship without taking into consideration the rest
of the properties of those things. Statements about the stuff a thing
is made of are true for every thing that is equisubstantial with it.
Thus the concepts of stuff res. substance are not predicators but
<I>abstractors</I>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
procedure outlined here for the introduction of the concept of
substance is an application of the general &#145;constructive&#146;
abstraction scheme that has been proposed by Lorenzen and has been
recently refined by Hartmann. According to this scheme an abstractor
is introduced in three steps:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.21cm; line-height: 150%"><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Similarly
the stuff words &#145;naphthalene&#146;, &#145;benzene&#146; etc. are
introduced by establishing particular equivalence relations with
definite values of the selected substantial properties. For instance,
all solid things that are homogeneously of a white colour, have a
crystalline texture, an average density of 0.9625 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>, a
characteristic smell, kill moths, and a melting point of 80.5 &deg;C
etc., are made of the stuff res. the substance &#145;naphthalene&#146;.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>To this introduction of
the term &#145;stuff&#146; and the stuff words via the
Lorenzen-Hartmann abstraction scheme (LH-abstraction) one could
object that it is not adequate since it is bound to a given aggregate
state. Everybody knows that water and ice consist of the same stuff
although in two different aggregate states. Thus the definition of
stuff seems to be underdetermined and the reference problem arises
again. The answer to this objection is that the equivalence relation
of equisubstantiality is indeed primarily confined to the aggregate
state of the things considered. Ice, water and steam <I>are</I> three
distinct stuffs. The circumstance that the equisubstantiality of
water things can be restored, is a contingent fact. Our daily life
world is filled with stuffs like honey, milk &#150; even marble, or
diamond &#150; that cannot survive any change of aggregate state. And
at any case this kind of persistence can only be determined after a
reconversion to the initial aggregate state, i.e. we know that water
and ice are the same stuff only because we can convert the one in to
the other by raising and lowering the temperature. Albeit this
&#145;interconvertibility&#146; is an important feature for the
selection of those stuffs that can be used for setting up a
&#145;substance genealogy&#146; in a chemical sense, as a property it
is methodically secondary.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>We have so far revealed
the semantic function of words like &#145;x-ray spectrometer&#146;
and &#145;naphthalene&#146;, i.e. of predicators and abstractors. In
our statement, however, we have still this ominous word &#145;molecule&#146;
that resists stubbornly any attempt to become subsumed under one of
the introduced semantic functions. Grammatically the word &#145;molecule&#146;
is used like a predicator. We add, combine, split it, or determine
its properties. On the other hand the object called &#145;molecule&#146;
is &#147;invisible&#148; but as we saw not in the same manner as a
transparent, a very small or a hidden body. Furthermore the objects
called &#145;molecules&#146; do not occur in the life world. They are
not something that we can buy in the market. Molecules occur only in
scientific theories. Therefore we will call such an entity a
<I>theoretical construct</I>. The words describing them have thus the
semantic function of <I>theoretical terms</I> or <I>theoretical
concepts</I>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Theoretical constructs
need not occur in every theory. Newton&#146;s theory of gravity for
example or Darwin&#146;s theory of evolution are construct free. Even
in chemistry there have been serious efforts to set up theories that
explain chemical phenomena without the aid of theoretical constructs
like atom or molecule. We will return to this later.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Some phenomena, however,
cannot be explained just by establishing relationships between
objects that are described with predicators and abstractors. A famous
example for such a case &#150; and by the way the cause for the
introduction of the molecules in chemistry &#150; is the law
governing chemical reactions between gases. As early as 1808
Gay-Lussac found out that when to gases were brought into reaction
their volumes, either as reactants or as products, always form ratios
of small integer numbers. Chlorine and Hydrogen for example react to
form Hydrogen Chloride in a volume ratio of 1:1:2, Oxygen and
Hydrogen react to Water vapour in a volume ratio of 2:1:2 an so
forth. Every gas reaction &#150; a chemical phenomenon &#150; is thus
accompanied by a reproducible variation of the volume of the
reactants &#150; a physical phenomenon. On the other hand there are
many reactions between substances in the solid and/or the liquid
state for which this law cannot easily been checked experimentally
because these substances cannot easily be transformed in the gaseous
state.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In order to explain
Gay-Lussac&#146;s law, the theoretical construct </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="page-break-before: always"><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><I>molecule</I>
has been introduced in the chemical theory. The chemists assumed that
the &#147;matter&#148; of a given chemical substance is not
homogeneously distributed in the volume that this substance occupied
but that it forms small corpuscles, the molecules. The result of a
reaction can now be interpreted as if the molecules of the one
reactant are combined with the molecules of the other. Thus one
molecule of Chlorine is combined with one molecule of Hydrogen to
form one molecule of Hydrogen Chloride. Because a reaction is a
chemical operation under controlled conditions, it has to be
performed according to the norm of the constancy of mass and the norm
of the constant proportions, i.e. the sum of the masses of the
products of the reactions must be equal to the sum of the masses of
the reactants and the products must show constant composition. Hence
equal volumes of two gases must contain equal numbers of molecules.
This would mean that one volume Chlorine gas and one Volume Hydrogen
gas should produce one volume of Hydrogen Chloride gas, what is not
the case. So it was further assumed that the molecules of Chlorine
and Hydrogen are split during the reaction into &#147;molecule
halves&#148; that recombine to form the molecules of Hydrogen
Chloride. In our modern chemical terminology these &#147;molecule
halves&#148; are the theoretical constructs <I>atoms</I>.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Let us now recapitulate
the function of the theoretical constructs atom and molecule in the
explanation of gas reactions:</FONT></FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In

	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The theoretical
	constructs molecule and atom help us to integrate both phenomena in
	one theory providing thus a good explanation for gas reactions.</FONT></FONT></P>
</UL>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In order to check the
validity of Gay-Lussac&#146;s law for substances that cannot be
vaporised easily the theoretical constructs molecule and atom are
provided with <I>theoretical properties</I> like &#147;atomic&#148;
and &#147;molecular mass&#148;, &#147;atomic valence&#148; and
&#147;molecular structure&#148; &#150; the latter being introduced by
establishing an equivalence relation between theoretical constructs
and geometrical forms!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Since its formulation in
1811 by Avogadro the modern molecular hypothesis has been proven very
successful in explaining and integrating chemical phenomena and also
in enabling the prediction of yet unknown ones. It has therefore
gained a firm place in the chemical theory. The clarification of the
semantic status of &#145;molecule&#146; and &#145;atom&#146; as
theoretical concepts of the chemical theory explains also why we did
not take up their use in ancient, medieval and early modern
philosophical theories like the doctrines of Democritus, Lucretius or
Gassendi or the chemical theories of Newton and Dalton.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The corpuscular chemical
theories developed by Newton and his contemporaries in the 18<SUP>th</SUP>
century are very interesting both from a historical and a
philosophical point of view. They have been formulated in order to
give a theoretical explanation of chemical phenomena using
theoretical constructs in the sense reconstructed here. However, the
explanation at that time for the chemical affinities of the
substances relied on Newton&#146;s gravitational theory that could
give an account for the attraction between the molecules but was not
adequate for the explanation of the particular affinities between
given substances. This fact, in combination with the lack of a
normative frame for the performance of chemical reactions and the
definition of the term &#147;chemical compound&#148;, resulted in the
rejection of the &#147;gravitational&#148; chemical theories by the
beginning of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century. The atomistic ideas of J.
Dalton who is sometimes regarded as the &#147;Father of the atomic
theory&#148; are also localised in the realm of natural philosophic
speculation, because he does not give any reason neither for the laws
of atomic combinations he formulates nor for the validity the
deductions he draws from them about the qualitative composition and
the molecular mass of chemical compounds like water, ammonia, nitric
acid, or carbon dioxide. The consequence of these failed efforts for
a corpuscular explanation of chemical phenomena was that the
introduction of these theoretical constructs in chemical theories was
discredited for a long time. Even the above mentioned successful
corpuscular explanation given by Avogadro for the chemical and
physical phenomena accompanying the reactions between gases did not
manage to overcome the reservation against the atomistic chemical
theories in chemical circles, a reservation that persisted until the
beginnings of our century. Among the most convinced representatives
of this anti-atomist or anti-corpuscular party have been the 1905
Nobel laureate Wilhelm Ostwald and the today lesser known Czech
chemist Frantisek Wald who in contrast to Ostwald opposed the atomic
theory until his death in 1930.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The scientific request
for a frame allowing the comparison of the efficacy and ensuring the
transsubjective performance of substance transforming procedures,
results in the formulation of the norm of the <I>conservation of

be performed so that the mass of its products equals the mass of its
raw materials. A transformation that complies with this norm and the
products of which are chemically pure substances is called <I>chemical
reaction</I>. Violation of the norm of the conservation of matter is
an indication that either there are products that undetectedly escape
from the reaction vessel, or that there is an unknown substance that
enters the reaction. The violation of this norm must not be
interpreted as the empirical proof of the transformation of matter
into &#147;energy&#148; or of its &#147;ex nihilo&#148; generation.</FONT></FONT></P>

products of its chemical <I>de</I>composition. Therefore we have to
formulate an additional norm, the norm of the <I>constant

<H1><A NAME="Ch5"></A><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Philosophy,
a partner of Chemistry</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>As a resume of the
project of a culturalistic philosophy of chemistry, we can state that
its aims are the methodical constitution of the objects, the
foundation of the basic terms and the formulation of the necessary
norms of this science in respect to the actions that are involved in
pre-scientific poietical practices in order to change the substantial
properties of things. The philosophical methods that are utilised for
performing this task are the determination of the semantic functions
of chemical terms, the application of various procedures of
philosophy of language, like the imperative and the ostentative
introduction of predicators, and the abstraction procedure for the
introduction of abstract terms, and the method of operative
definition for the establishing of the meaning of equivalence
relations avoiding thus indefinite regresses or a violation of the
principle of methodical order.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><FONT FACE="Garamond, serif">From this description of
the main issues of a culturalistic philosophy of chemistry, the role
of modern philosophy in its relationship to science emerges in a new
light. Philosophy is neither the teacher of dogmas that are imposed
on science, permitting or forbidding the acquisition of knowledge
with the one or the other method in this or the other area. Nor is
philosophy <I>ancilla scientorum </I>destined to deliver ex post
legitimisations for laboratory made decisions that have an impact on
society. Between philosophy and the sciences in general, or more
specific, between philosophy of chemistry and chemistry exists rather
a relation of partnership and division of labour. While chemistry
operates at the frontiers of knowledge acquisition sustaining the
practices that provide mankind with the substantial means for
satisfying its everyday needs and perhaps improving its quality of
life, philosophy acts on the background founding and evaluating the
linguistic tools that chemistry uses for the organisation and
communication of this knowledge, and making aware of the fact that
man is the originator of the aims, the objects and the methods of
chemistry and thus the beneficiary and the victim of his own actions.</FONT></FONT></P>
