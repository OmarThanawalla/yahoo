Most of the time when a person thinks of the definition of a family, the image of a mother, father and children is what comes into the mind. That is actually the definition of a nuclear family, which is parents, and one or more children.

For example, an anthropologist may focus his or her research on a particular dimension of culture, such as religion or political organization, but that dimension will also be described in terms of its relationship to the "complex whole" of the local culture.

But even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods, ethnography is not the sine of the discipline, as it is in cultural anthropology.

Arguably peasants still nourish conservative attitudes to folk women. Structural and symbolic violence originating from custom, scriptures and pre-existing values tend to undermine women's autonomous status at home and outside the residential locus.

When anthropology developed as an empirical science, evolutionism was replaced by functionalism negating the prior assumption. Later in the mid-twentieth century French anthropologist as well as philosopher Levi-Strauss introduced a new and different theoretical model in the study of culture named ‘Structuralism’.

She thinks if doctors want to help patients change their health-related behaviors, they need to understand where their patients are coming from, and anthropology teaches that.

Anthropological knowledge has the potential to inform and instruct humans about how to construct sustainable ways of life. Anthropology, especially when it has an environmental focus, also demonstrates the importance of preserving cultural diversity.
