<STRONG>We have a request:</STRONG><BR> 
Please send us your age category (K - 4<SUP>th</SUP> grade, 5<SUP>th</SUP> - 8<SUP>th</SUP> grade, 9<SUP>th</SUP> - 12<SUP>th</SUP> grade, undergraduate student, graduate student, or adult out of school) when you send us a question.  It is much easier to send you an appropriate answer when we know this.  Thanks!<BR><BR>

<HR>

<STRONG>We strive to provide complete, understandable answers to questions about cosmic and heliospheric science and to encourage all to explore the many varied facets of scientific study.  But before you send us your question, there are a few things we'd like for you to know</STRONG>:

<UL>
<LI>Please read through the <A HREF="#q&a">answers to previous questions</A> before you ask us a question.  <FONT COLOR="red"><EM><STRONG>We will not answer questions that have already been answered.</STRONG></EM></FONT><P> 
<LI>We can only answer questions that are written in English.<P>
<LI>Unfortunately, some questions will not be answered because they are beyond our area of expertise or interest. Our field is, for the most part, limited to particles in the heliosphere.  This covers: 
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="compos.html">composition</A> 
<LI><A HREF="magfield.html">magnetic fields</A> (including those of the <A HREF="solarmag.html">Sun</A> and <A HREF="magnet.html">Earth</A>)

<LI><A HREF="history.html">history</A> of cosmic ray and heliospheric studies
</UL><P>
Due to the high volume of questions we are now receiving, <FONT COLOR="red"><EM><STRONG>we must be more strict about adhering to these subjects</STRONG></EM></FONT>.  We will, however, maintain the past questions and their answers on the site. There are several other sites that might be able to answer your questions in other areas of science. Here are just a few:
<UL><P>
<LI>High-energy astrophysics (binary star systems, black holes,
cosmology, dark matter, neutron stars, quasars, stars, X-rays and
gamma-rays): <A
HREF="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/ask_an_astronomer.html">Ask

<LI>Comets: <A HREF="http://www.nineplanets.org/comets.html">The Nine Planets</A><P>

<LI>Highly technical questions, or those that require us to do a lot of research, will probably not be answered.<P>

<LI>We cannot carry on long email discussions; we only have time to answer your question once.  Please reply to that answer ONLY if we have not made it clear enough to you.<P>  

<LI>Please limit yourself to one email, and generally one question, per week.<P>

<LI>Please don't send attachments in your email.<P> 

<LI>We don't do homework!<P>

<BR><H3 ALIGN="center">Still have a question after reading all of the above?</H3>
Email your question to: <A HREF="mailto:cosmicopia@cosmicra.gsfc.nasa.gov">cosmicopia@cosmicra.gsfc.nasa.gov</A><P>

<DIV ALIGN="left"><STRONG>Your question may be answered in hours or in weeks; for most questions, it's somewhere in-between.  The time to reply depends on many factors: how many other questions we have received, the complexity of your question, and the other projects that our scientists are involved in. These are working NASA scientists, after all!</STRONG><BR><BR>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="about">About our volunteer team of astrophysicists:</A></H3>

<DIV ALIGN="left">

<STRONG><A HREF="lmb.html">Dr. Louis Barbier</A></STRONG> is interviewed about being an astrophysicist: a typical day, his projects, the job market, etc.  This interview is from questions received from one of our readers.<P>

<STRONG><A
HREF="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/bios/christian/eric_c.html">Dr.
Eric Christian</A></STRONG> is a Research Scientist in the Heliophysics
Division at NASA GSFC. He studies energetic particles in the
heliosphere using instruments on the ACE, IBEX, STEREO, and Voyager
spacecraft. More details on his background and scientific interests can
be read in an old (2003) interview by clicking on his name.<P>

<STRONG>Dr. Georgia A. de Nolfo</STRONG> is currently a research scientist at NASA/GSFC.  Her research interests focus on the physics of high energy cosmic rays including the analysis of data from both high-altitude balloon-borne experiments such as <A HREF="http://tiger.gsfc.nasa.gov">TIGER</A> and space-based experiments such as <A HREF="http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/">ACE</A>. <P>

<STRONG>Dr. Jeff George</STRONG> is no longer answering questions, but
during his stint, his work was at Caltech, using data from NASA's <A

<STRONG>Dr. Nicholas (Nick) Sterling</STRONG> is a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA/GSFC.  His research interests involve the study of planetary nebulae via spectroscopy.  Specifically, he studies exotic elements in these objects, including selenium, bromine, krypton, and xenon, which can be produced by the low-mass stars that form planetary nebulae.  He is also interested in the atomic properties of these elements, which are vital for accurately determining their abundances.<P>

<STRONG>Dr. Edward F. (Ed) Tedesco</STRONG> is an Associate Research Professor at the University of New Hampshire. He mainly studies asteroids using observations at visual and infrared wavelengths obtained with ground- and space-based telescopes. He is currently President of the <A HREF="http://atlas.sr.unh.edu/IAU_Comm15/">International Astronomical Union's Commission on Physical Studies of Comets and Minor Planets</A>.<P>

<STRONG>Dr. Pin Wu</STRONG> is a postdoc research associate at the
University of Delaware. She has published journal papers about the
Earth's magnetosphere, solar coronal mass ejections, and the
heliospheric termination shock. She is currently working on
particle-in-cell simulation of magnetic reconnection, as well as MHD
turbulence.<P>
