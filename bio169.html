<p align="center"><font size="5">What is a forensic anthropologist?<br>
How does forensic anthropology differ from <br>
forensic pathology?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008080" size="4">General information:</font> </p>

<p align="left">Forensic anthropology is a subdiscipline within the subfield of physical
anthropology. Anthropology is typcially comprised of three subfields: cultural
anthropology, archaeology, and physical (aka biological) anthropology. Some people still
include linguistics as a fourth subfield, but more commonly this area is being absorbed by
the other three.</p>

<p align="left">Other disciplines in physical anthropology: genetics, human growth and
development, primatology (study of primates), paleoanthropology (primate and human
evolution), human osteology (study of the skeleton), paleodemography (vital statistics of
past populations), skeletal biology, nutrition, dental anthropology, human adaptation and
variation (to different climates, altitudes, etc.)--and this is just to name a few...</p>

<p align="left">Forensic anthropology is an &quot;applied&quot; area. It borrows methods
and techniques developed from skeletal biology and osteology and applies them to cases of
forensic importance. Forensic means &quot;legal.&quot; </p>

<p align="left">Methods and techniques to assess age, sex, stature, ancestry, and analyze
trauma and disease are generally developed to help anthropologists understand different
populations living all over the world at different times throughout history. When we take
these methods and apply them to unknown modern human remains, with the aim of establishing
identity or manner of death, then we are practicing the forensic application of osteology.</p>

<p align="left">This means that to be a forensic anthropologist, you must first study all
the subfields of anthropology, at least to some degree, then get a good grasp of physical
anthropology--especially osteology. From there, you can specialize in how to use osteology
in forensic cases.</p>

<p align="left">Those of you who are unable to find degree programs in forensic
anthropology should limit your search to physical anthropology, then focus on osteology or
skeletal biology, and finally look for people who do forensic cases.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008080" size="4">How does a forensic anthropologist differ
from a forensic pathologist?</font></p>

<p><font color="#008080">Forensic anthropologists</font> are experienced osteologists.
Forensic anthropologists usually hold a doctorate degree (Ph.D.); but many have a Master's
degree (MA) in anthropology; and only in rare cases do some hold a Bachelor's degree
(BA)--these forensic anthropologists typically have years of extensive training,
nonetheless.</p>

<p>Forensic anthropologists with advanced (graduate) degrees usually (but not always) work
in an academic setting--at a college or university. This employment setting involves
teaching courses, conducting research, and providing service--such as forensic
consultation services. Other employment settings for forensic anthropologists can include
work in laboratories (FBI, state bureaus of investigation, or private firms), or medical
examiner/coroner facilities nationwide and worldwide.</p>

<p><font color="#008080">Forensic pathologists</font> are medical doctors, physicians,
with a specialization in forensic pathology. Forensic pathologists perform autopsies
(examinations of people who have died) in the endeavor to establish the cause of death.
Causes of death may be classified different ways such as natural, accidental, suicidal,
homicidal, etc.</p>

<p>Whereas the forensic anthropologist's general focus in on bones, the forensic
pathologist's general focus in on soft tissue (including organs and body fluid analyses).
Forensic pathologists hold a doctor of medicine degree (MD), which requires a bachelor's
degree with &quot;pre-med&quot; courses, four years of medical school, followed by a
residency in pathology, then further training in forensic pathology. Not all doctors who
perform autopsies are forensic pathologists; however, in complex cases, forensic
pathologists are usually consulted.</p>
