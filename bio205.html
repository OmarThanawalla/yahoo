<strong>Research Associate Professor Mary Emond</strong> is lead author on a recent study in Nature Genetics. The reported research used exome sequencing and an extreme phenotype design to discover genetic variants associated with serious infections in cycstic fibrosis patients. Graduate student Wei Zhao and Research Scientist Tin Louie also collaborated on the study.
<strong>Cathy Laurie</strong>, Biostatistics Principal Senior Research Scientist, and many other Biostatistics colleagues published an important study in the most recent edition of <em>Nature Genetics</em>. By careful statistical analysis of DNA intensity data from over 50,000 subjects, the research demonstrates the existence of large-scale chromosomal anomalies that arise during our lifetimes, and that increase our risks for some cancers. Other UW Biostatistics faculty and staff on the project include Patrick Heagerty, Ken Rice, Bruce Weir, Siiri Bennett, David Crosslin, Stephanie Gogarten, Cecelia Laurie, David Levine, Sarah Nelson, Jess Shen and Jenna Udren. Biostatistics graduate students Matt Conomos, Caitlin McHugh, Leila Zelnick and Xiuwen Zheng are also co-authors, as well as Gail Jarvik from the UW Division of Medical Genetics. You can read about the paper, and a coordinated submission from the National Cancer Institute, as well as find a link to the paper <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
