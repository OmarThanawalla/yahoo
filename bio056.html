      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left">Dear Colleagues:<br>
          <br>
          If you have a copy of our book Paleobotany: &#8220;The Biology and Evolution 
          of Fossil Plants&#8221; &#8211; Academic Press, 2009. Taylor, Taylor, 
          and Krings, we have a favor to ask. In anticipation of a second print 
          run, we would like to pick up any typos, etc. that you might have found 
          while reading. If you could send these in an e-mail message to: <a href="tntaylor@ku.edu">tntaylor@ku.edu</a> 
          we would be most appreciative.</p>
        <p align="left"> In addition, if you purchased a copy of the book in the 
          US from Amazon etc. the International Stratigraphic Chart may be missing 
          as an end paper in the first several pages. If you&#8217;ll send me 
          a note, I&#8217;ll send that page to you, or you can click on the picture 
          of the book cover that is displayed at our web site listed below, and 
          print a copy of the chart. </p>

      <blockquote> 
        <div align="left"> 
          <p>&quot;The Paleobotanical Section of Botanical Society of America 
            is the oldest organization of Paleobotanists in the world. The founding 
            father of the Section in the years of 1934-1936 was Loren C. Perry, 
            then of Cornell University. Paleobotanical contributions at the Botanical 
            Society of America's meetings had customarily been presented before 
            the General Section. Professor Perry initiated discussions of forming 
            a formal organization of the Paleobotany Section. The idea was enhanced 
            by the visit to the U.S.A. of Dr. H. Hamshaw Thomas during the Pittsburgh 
            meeting of the Botanical Society.</p>
          <p>The Botanical Society Council minutes for the 30th Annual Meeting, 
            at Washington University, St. Louis, December 31, 1935 - January 2, 
            1936, include an item: 'The Secretary reported a movement on the part 
            of several of the younger members interested in paleobotany to ask 
            for the formation of a paleobotanical section. The Council informally 
            expressed its hearty approval of such action.' The minutes for the 
            corresponding meeting at Atlantic City, December 29-31, 1936, include 
            an item:'The Secretary reported plans for the organization of a Paleobotanical 
            Section of the Society. The Council voted its approval of the proposal 
            to organize such a Section.'</p>
        </div>
        <div align="left">Whether one accepts the initial decision of the paleobotanists 
          to organize in 1934 , or the final acceptance of the proposal in 1936, 
          the Paleobotanical Section of the Botanical Society of America is the 
          oldest formal organization of paleobotanists in the world.&quot;</div>
