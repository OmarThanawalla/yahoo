<b><big>What is Life's Big Instruction Book</big></b>
<p>
Life's Big Instruction book is about biology and biotechnology.  It consists of a number of parts:
<ul>
<li><a href = "toc.html">Life's Big Instruction Book</a>, a primer on
modern biology with an emphasis on genetics
<li><a href = "faq/faq.html">a biology and biotechnology FAQ</a>
<li>introductions to two things about business that seem to come up in 
discussions of biotechnology:
  <ul>
  <li><a href = "business/agribusiness.html">agribusiness</a>
  <li><a href = "business/patents.html">patents</a>
  </ul>
<li>a short discussion of <a href = "faq/risks.html">risks</a>
</ul>
<b><big>Why and How is Life's Big Instruction Book</big></b>
<p>
I made this site because I believe most people's fear of biotechnology
is simply ignorance.  Not only ignorance of biotechnology, but also of
biology: DNA, mutation, evolution, and all the rest.  The last time
most people studied biology was in high school.  For many of them,
that was a long time ago -- certainly before biotechnology was
advanced enough to be taught in high school.  So, it's not surprising
that people are ignorant or confused.  Nor is it surprising that
they're afraid of what they don't know.  Fortunately, there's a cure
for that fear: learning.  That's what this site is for: learning about
biology.
<p>
<p>
The whole site is linked together with hypertext.  If you
want, you can start out with the <a href = "gen-engineer.html">section
on biotechnology</a>, see <a href =
"faq/faq-biotech.html#a-biot-risks-geneng">why biotechnology isn't so
bad</a>, or take a look at <a href ="mass-breed.html">artificial
selection</a>, one of the other genetic manipulation techniques people
use.  All of the technical terms used on the pages are
linked back to where they're defined, so if you run into a word you
don't know, you can jump to the where I give its meaning.  You can
also jump around via the links; there's really no need to read each
section in order.  Of course, if you don't know much about biology,
you might as well <a href = "intro.html">start at the beginning</a>
and read at least a few of the sections before jumping into the <a
href = "faq/faq.html">FAQ</a>.
<p>
I've been asked if I'm "pro-biotechnology".  This always strikes me as
funny; I think it's like being asked if I'm "pro-electricity" or
"pro-hammer" or pro any other tool people have thought up.  All tools
are good at some things, and bad at others.  Biotechnology has its
place, too.  I think it's a large and useful place -- it can help us
do many things in agriculture and medicine -- but it can't do
everything.  Nor is it without risk, though the risks are small, and
no different than risks we already face from other genetic
manipulation techniques.  (Yes!  There are <a href
="mass-breed.html">others</a>, and people have been using them for
thousands of years, usually with no understanding or awareness of how
or why they work.  Delicious food and cute pets didn't just happen by
themselves.)
<p>
To a certain extent, I don't care if people reject biotechnology, so
long as they do it for the right reasons: understanding the facts,
putting those facts in perspective, and weighing the costs and
benefits.  Rejecting biotechnology (or anything else) merely because
it's new, or different, or because it seems mysterious is silly.
Everything we do or use now was once new, different, and mysterious.
<p>
In this site, I tend to use "we" a lot.  Even though I wrote nearly
all the text and made all the pretty pictures, I got a lot of helpful
advice and encouragement from friends and colleagues.  I also asked a
number of people for their opinion on various issues, and merged them
into the FAQ.  So, "we" rather than "I".
<p>
But enough about me.  This site is for learning about biology, so
scroll back to the top of the page, pick a spot, jump in, and start
learning!

<small>P.S.  Two disclaimers:
<p>
A number of us work for companies that either breed plants, genetically
engineer them, or both.
<p>
No one, either for or against biotechnology, has given us any financial
support for this web site.  Nor do our employers know we're doing this.
