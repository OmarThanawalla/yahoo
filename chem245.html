    <strong>Summary:</strong><br>
    Chem-It is a program for the novice Chemistry student.&nbsp; I always found that I could
    never get everything together when I was doing my Chemistry problem sets.&nbsp; I'd always
    be juggling between the periodic table, conversion charts, and my laptop.&nbsp; Chem-It
    was designed in response to this problem.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Program:</strong><br>
    Chem-It offers everything the Chemistry student needs to work efficiently.&nbsp; The
    program performs common conversions automatically.&nbsp; There are reference areas which
    contain commonly used constants.&nbsp; The interactive periodic table houses all
    information a student might need about each element.&nbsp; The mass calculator allows you
    to calculate the mass of very complex substances using simple menus.&nbsp; During
    experiments, there is a built-in timer which makes it easy to time reactions. &nbsp;
    Additionally, there is a built in text editor which allows you to type your experiment
    notes without leaving the program.<br>

    to read what some of the other 35,000+ registered users of Chem-It are saying about the
    program.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Cost:<br>
    </strong>Chem-It was formerly a freeware program.&nbsp; However, due to the cost of
    development and my decreasing amount of free time, I have found it necessary to charge a
    small registration fee of <strong style="font-weight: 400">$7.95</strong> for the program.&nbsp; I believe this is
    a small price to pay in exchange for the features offered by Chem-It.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The registration fee entitles the user to free technical support for
    one year from the date of registration.&nbsp; Additionally, the next version of Chem-It
    (version 2.0) will be free to registered users of Chem-It 1.1.&nbsp; When version 2.0 is
    released we will also provide technical support to get it up and running on your system,
    regardless of when you register Chem-It 1.1.<br>
