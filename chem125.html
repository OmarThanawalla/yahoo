<h3>Arsole</h3>

<p>Yes, believe it or not, there is actually a molecule called <i>Arsole</i>... and it's a ring! It is the arsenic equivalent of pyrrole, and although it is rarely found in its pure form, it is occasionally seen as a sidegroup in the form of organic <i>arsolyls</i>. For more information, see the paper with probably the best title of any scientific paper I've ever come across: "<a href="arsole1.pdf">Studies on the Chemistry of the Arsoles</a>", G. Markl and H. Hauptmann, <i>J. Organomet. Chem</i>., <b>248</b> (1983) 269.  Although the class of molecules with this general structure are called 'arsoles', the specific molecule shown on the right is actually called 'arsenole' (not to be confused with the London football club, Arsenal).  Contrary to popular belief, new research (see reference below) shows that arsoles are only moderately aromatic...  Incidentally US patent number US 3 412 119 by the Dow Chemical Company is entitled 'Substituted Stannoles, Phospholes, Arsoles, and Stiboles' - I didn't know there was a substitute for an arsole...<br />
Furthermore, if six of them are bonded together we can apply the prefix 'sexi', to get 'sexiarsole'.  And the structure where arsole is fused to a benzene ring is called 'benzarsole'; 6 of these bonded together would be called 'sexibenzarsole' (although neither of those sexi- molecules  have been synthesised yet).  Another well known poisonous arsenic molecule is the simple hydride, called 'arsine', with formula AsH<sub>3</sub>.<br />
And on a related theme, I've been told of an Aryl Selenide compound with the superb shorthand of ArSe, which is both toxic and smelly.  The <a href="ArSe.pdf">paper it comes from in <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc</i>.</a> was published by authors from, of course, the University of Aarhus!  I've been told that it's possible to make molecules with Se-Se bonds, so if ArSe is bonded to a selenium halide (with X representing Br, Cl, etc), then it's possible to make ArSe-SeX.  I'll leave this as a challenge to synthetic chemists to first try to make this compound, and then to try to get its name in the title of a paper!<br />
Also, the related molecule <a href="phosphole.mol">phosphole</a> (which just replaces As with P) is quite amusing if you are a French speaker, since it's pronounced the same as '<i>fausse folle</i>'.  <i>Fausse</i> means 'fake' or 'false', and <i>folle</i> means both a 'crazy woman' and a 'drag-queen' or 'ladyboy'.</p>

<p class="ref">Thanks to Neil Brookes, Nicholas Welham, Andy Shipway, Lloyd Evans, Peter Sims, John Perkins, Bob Buntrock and Ben Mills for some of the info and details about these molecules. This article inspired Mikael Johansson from Helsinki University to do a scientific study into the aromaticity of arsoles, which has been published: <i>Letts. Org. Chem.</i> <b>2</b> (2005) 469.   Another intriguing reference supplied by Patrick Wallace is:  <a href="arsole2.pdf">G. M&auml;rkl and H. Hauptmann, "Unusual Substitution in an Arsole Ring", <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. </i>. <b>11</b>, (1972) 441</a>, and another one supplied by Simon Cotton is: "Arsole metal complexes", E.W. Abel, I.W. Nowell, A.G.J. Modinos, C. Towers, <i>J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun</i>., (1973) (7), 258-259.  Thanks also to Thomas Jeanmaire and Alan Parker for the info and translation about phosphole.</p>

<p><h3>Bastardane</b></h3>

<p>This is actually a close relative of adamantane, and its proper name is ethano-bridged noradamantane. However because it had the unusual ethano bridge, 
and was therefore a variation from the standard types of structure found in the field of hydrocarbon cage rearrangements, it came to be known as <i>bastardane</i> - the "unwanted child".  In fact the <a href="./bastardane.pdf">original paper</a> had the title "Nonacyclo-docosane, a Bastard Tetramantane".<br />
A related cage hydrocarbon was called <i>Golcondane</i> by the first people to synthesis it in 1993, Mehta and Reddy, in honour of the 400th anniversary of the founding of the Indian city of Hyderabad, whose ancient name was Golconda.</p>

<h3>Buckminster Fullerene</h3>

<p>This is the famous soccerball-shaped molecule that won its discoverers the <a href="http://www.nobel.se/announcement-96/chemistry96.html">Nobel prize for Chemistry in 1996</a>. It is named after the architect Buckminster Fuller who designed the geodesic dome exhibited at Expo '67 in Montreal, from which Sir Harry Kroto got the idea how 60 Carbon atoms could be arranged in a perfectly symmetrical fashion. Because the name of the molecule is a bit of a mouthful, it is often referred to just as a <i><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/Chemistry/MOTM/buckyball/c60a.htm"> Bucky Ball</a></i>.  It's also known as 'Footballene' by some researchers. In fact, there is now a whole '<a href="http://www.jcrystal.com/steffenweber/gallery/Fullerenes/Fullerenes.html">fullerene zoo</a>', with oddly coined names, including:  <i>Buckybabies </i> (C<sub>32</sub>, C<sub>44</sub>, C<sub>50</sub>, C<sub>58</sub>), <i>Rugby Ball</i> (C<sub>70</sub>), <i>Giant Fullerenes</i> (C<sub>240</sub>, C<sub>540</sub>, C<sub>960</sub>), <i>Russian Egg</i> or <i>Bucky Onions</i> (balls within balls), <i>Fuzzyball</i> (C<sub>60</sub>H<sub>60</sub>), <i><a href="http://wunmr.wustl.edu/EduDev/Fullerene/confirmation.html">Bunnyball</a></i> (C<sub>60</sub>(OsO<sub>4</sub>)(4-t-Butylpyridine)<sub>2</sub>), <i>Platinum-Burr Ball</i> ({[(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>P]<sub>2</sub>Pt}<sub>6</sub>C<sub>60</sub>) and <i>Hetero-fullerenes</i> (in which some Cs are replaced by other atoms).<br />
There is also a fullerene paper in which the authors describe a method for severing two adjacent bonds in C<sub>60</sub>, entitled "<a href="buckyhole.pdf">There Is a Hole in My Bucky</a>".  And finally, there's evena  village in France called <a href="http://www.annuaire-mairie.fr/mairie-fulleren.html">Fulleren</a>, although it's unrelated to the molecule.</p>

<p class="ref">Thanks to A. Haymet for the info regarding footballene, and to Charles Turner for the names of the other fullerenes which came from: <i>'Fullerenes'</i>, by Robert F. Curl and Richard E. Smalley, <i>Scientific American</i> October 1991, and to Tom Hawkins for the JACS reference, and to Patrick Henry for the French village name.</p>

<h3>Putrescine, Cadaverine, Spermine and Spermidine</h3> 

<p>Putrescine originates in putrefying and rotting flesh, and is quite literally, the smell of death. It is one of the breakdown products of some of the 
amino-acids found in animals, including humans. Although the molecule is a poisonous solid, as flesh decays the vapour pressure of the putrescine it contains becomes sufficiently large to allow its disgusting odour to be detected. It is usually accompanied by cadaverine (named after the cadavers that give rise to it), a poisonous syrupy liquid with an equally disgusting smell. Putrescine and cadaverine also contribute towards the smells of some living processes. Since they are both poisonous, the body normally excretes them in whatever way is quickest and most convenient. For example, the odour of bad breath and urine are 'enriched' by the presence of these molecules, as is the 'fishy' smell of the discharge from the female medical condition <i>bacterial vaginosis</i>. Putrescine and cadaverine also contribute to the distinctive smell of semen, which also contains the related molecules spermine and spermidine.</p>

<h3>Moronic Acid</h3>

<p>This is a triterpenoid organic acid that is found in <i>Pistacia</i> resin, and is therefore of interest to people studying archaeological relics, shipwrecks and the contents of ancient Egyptian jars. Its name comes from its corresponding hydroxy acid, which was originally named <i>morolic acid</i> since it was isolated from the heartwood of the mora tree, <i>mora excelsa</i>.  The keto acid then became moronic acid.  Derivatives of this are called <i>moronates</i>, as in 'which moron-ate the contents of this jar?'  It's currently being studied as a potential treatment for HIV and herpes.</p>

<h3>Curious Chloride and Titanic Chloride</h3>

<p>The trivial name for some curium compounds can be either curous or 'curious', so curium trichloride becomes <i>curious chloride</i>. However the only 
curious property it has is that it's sufficiently radioactive that a solution, if concentrated enough, will boil spontaneously after a while. (I wonder if a molecule with 2 Cm atoms in would be 'bi-curious'...?)<br />
In a similar way, titanium compounds can be 'titanic', so we get the wonderfully named titanic chloride, TiCl<sub>4</sub>. It's also interesting to know that in the titanium industry, TiCl<sub>4</sub> is known as 'tickle'. Furthermore, curium oxides are called 'curates', so the titanium compound would be <i>Titanic Curate</i>, and since curium can have more than one valency we could end up with <i>Curious Curates</i>.  But I'm sure these are already a well-known phenomenon...<br />
In a similar way, some nickel compounds can be referred to as 'nickelous' - so we get compounds like <i>Nickelous Sulfate</i> (a nice guy by all accounts...) </p>

<p class="ref">Thanks to Beveridge and Dr Justin E. Rigden for supplying these two and to John Burgess and Neil Tristram for the ideas on curates, and to Michael Geyer for the Nickelous content.</p>

<h3>Fucitol</h3>

<p>Although this sounds like what an undergraduate chemist might exclaim when their synthesis goes wrong, it's actually an alcohol, whose other names are 
L-fuc-ol or 1-deoxy-D-galactitol. It gets its wonderful trivial name from the fact that it is derived from the sugar fucose, which comes from a seaweed found in the North Atlantic called Bladderwrack whose latin name is <i>Fucus vesiculosis</i>. Interestingly, there are a few articles in the <i>Journal of 
Biochemistry</i> throughout 1997 concerning a kinase enzyme which acts on fucose. The creators of these articles were Japanese, and seemed to have missed the fact that fucose kinase should not be abbreviated as '<a href="http://biocyc.org/ECOLI/new-image?type=GENE-IN-MAP&object=EG10350">fuc-K</a>'.  Similarly, the <i>E. coli</i> K-12 Gene has other proteins that have been named <a href="http://biocyc.org/ECOLI/new-image?type=GENE-IN-MAP&object=EG10355">Fuc-U</a> and <a href="http://biocyc.org/ECOLI/new-image?type=GENE-IN-MAP&object=EG10353">Fuc-R</a>.  Recently, the abbreviation for fucose-kinase enzyme has been cleaned up to 'FUK'.  However, there are now clones of this where the cloning position in the DNA sequence is labelled by its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame">Open Reading Frame</a> (ORF) number.  And of course, these clones are called <i><b>FUK ORF</b></i>! </p>

The seeds are sometimes called 'Quaker buttons', and are a source of strychnine as well as the emetic vomicine.  Similarly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomitoxin">vomitoxin</a> (right) is a toxin that's produced by certain types of fungus that grow on wheat and barley.  Its proper name is deoxynivalenol, but was given the trivial name vomitoxin because it caused vomiting in pigs that had eaten contaminated wheat.  It must be pretty gross to make even a pig vomit...</p>

<p class="ref">Thanks to Bill Longman and Alan Howard Martin for info on vomicene, and to Victoria Ludowici for info about vomitoxin.  More details: <a href="vomitoxin.pdf">R.F. Vesonder, A. Ciegler, A.H. Jensen, <i>Appl. Microbiol</i>., <b>26</b> (1973) 1008</a>.</p>

<h3>Gossypol</h3>
<p>This ridiculously named molecule is found in cotton seeds. It was used as a male contraceptive in China, but was never used in the West (and may have since been banned in China as well), since its effects were permanent in about 20% of patients!  Its name originated from being present in the flowers of the Indian cotton plant <i>Gossypium herbaceum L</i>.  Apart from its contraceptive effects, gossypol has properties that might make it useful in treating a number of ailments, including cancer, HIV, malaria and some bacterial/viral illnessness. Related to this molecule are the equally strangely named <b>gossypetin</b> and <b>gossypin</b>.  I always thought 'gossypin' was frowned upon in polite labs...</p>

<h3>Skatole</b></h3>
<p>This molecule's name comes from 'skatalogical', meaning concerning fecal material. Its proper name is 3-methylindole, but it gets its trivial name from the fact that it is a component of feces.

Skatole consists of white crystals when pure (or brownish scales when impure) which are soluble in hot water.  Apparently, coriander can be used to cover up bad smells such as these, as testified in the classic paper: "Deodorizing Effect of Coriander on the Offensive Odor of the Porcine Large Intestine" [<a href="coriander.pdf">Kohara <i>et al</i>, <i>Food Sci.

<h3>Sexithiophene</h3>

<p>This is a 'sexi' molecule - which means it has 6 sub-units, in this case of thiophene rings. Because of its conjugated system of double bonds, this organic molecule conducts electricity quite well. As a result, it is one of a number of similar molecules being studied for possible uses in organic polymer electronics.  Incidentally, the Latin for 5 sub-units is <i>quinque</i> (pronounced 'kinky'), so by adding one subunit a <i>quinque</i> molecule becomes <i>sexi</i>... Nine units would be <i>nonakis</i>...which shows what always happens if you try to take things too far.</p>

<h3>Godnose</h3>

<p>Ok, so this is a bit of a cheat, since it's not an official molecular name...but it makes a nice story. When Albert Szent-Gyorgyi isolated ascorbic acid and published his findings, he called the new substance 'ignose' since he was convinced it was a sugar that resembled glucose and fructose, but was ignorant of its structure. When the journal editor refused to accept ignose as a sensible name, Szent-Gyorgyi suggested 'Godnose' instead! Alas the editor was neither imaginative nor humorous, and suggested that a more proper name had to be used. The structure of the carbohydrate was elucidated in collaboration with Haworth at Birmingham and the alternative name given was hexuronic acid (hex = six). During the same period (1928�1931), Charles Glen King of the Columbia University of USA isolated Vitamin C from lemon juice and it was observed that hexuronic acid and Vitamin C were identical.  Szent-Gy�rgyi documents the episode in the essay "<a href="lost.pdf">Lost in the Twentieth Century</a>" which dates from 1963.</p>
