When one looks up into the night sky we only see stars and the
occasional planet.  Most of outer space is empty, meaning that the
density of atoms is much lower than even the best vacuums in our
labs.  Deep imaging of the skies showed that there are numerous
regions where interstellar matter, in the form of gas and dust,
collects to form clouds and nebula.  Since these clouds are diffuse,
they are difficult to see with the naked eye.<p>

The first indication that there was interstellar gas and dust was dark
lanes in the Milky Way.  Since we live in a disk galaxy, then looking
outward we see a band of light in the sky which, if magnified, breaks
down into the many stars in our Galaxy.  A deep photo of the Milky Way
shows that there are dark regions or lanes.<p>

We understand now that there is gas and dust blocking the starlight
which produces these dark lanes, such as the <a
href="../../images/coalsack.gif">CoalSack Nebula</a>. In fact, most of
our Galaxy is blocked from our view by <a
href="../../images/milkyway_gleason_big.jpg">patches of gas and dust</a>.<p>

<u>Interstellar Extinction</u>:<p>

Astrophotograph in the 19th century showed that the dark lanes or holes
in the Milky Way did not have sharp edges.  That, in fact, detail
studies of star clusters at various distances from us showed that the
intensity of light from remote stars is reduced as it passes through the
sparse material of the interstellar medium.  Herschel tried to use star
counts to measure the size of the Galaxy and where our position is
within it. His result was the diagram below, but what he really
discovered was that interstellar extinction limits our line of sight.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/herschel.gif"></center><p>

Not only is the intensity of the light decreased, called interstellar
extinction, it is also reddened, called interstellar reddening.   The
blue component of light is more easily scattered than the red component
(which is why the sky is blue during the day, scattered sunlight).
Thus, light from remote stars has part of its blue component scattered
before it reaches the Earth.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/interstellar_reddening.gif"></center><p>

Maps of interstellar reddening demonstrated that the interstellar medium
is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium gas (99%) and traces of dust.  Dust,
in an interstellar sense, is very small (few microns in size) particles
of carbon and silicon.  Dust is fragile because it can be broken down by
UV photons, but is very important in dark nebula as sites for the
formation of molecules.<p>

<u>Neutral Hydrogen</u>:<p>

Most of the interstellar medium is in the form of neutral hydrogen
gas (HI). The typical densities of neutral hydrogen in the Galaxy is
one atom per cubic centimeter.  This gas is cold and the electron is
usually in its ground state.  However, protons and electrons can have
spin.  This spin produces a magnetic field such that when the spins are
aligned the ground state has a slightly higher energy then when the
spins are opposed.  This is called hyperfine splitting of the ground state for
hydrogen and results in the emission of 21 cm radio waves from HI
clouds.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/21cm_radiation.jpg"></center><p>

The spins of the electron can be changed by collisions with other
hydrogen atoms, although this is very rare because the densities are so
low, or the transition can happen naturally after a few
million years. On the other hand, there are billions and billions of
hydrogen atoms in the typical cloud of gas.  So the result is that 21 cm
is a strong measure of the amount of HI gas in the Galaxy.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/hi_spiral.gif"></center><p>

A scan of our Milky Way galaxy at 21 cm shows that the distribution of neutral hydrogen is concentrated in the spiral arms.  The Sun is marked as the
yellow arrow, Galactic center is a blue dot.  Notice how there is a cone
of avoidance behind the Galactic center due to confusion in the HI
signal.<p>

<u>Interstellar Molecules</u>:<p>

Atoms can bond together to form molecules.  The most common atoms
in the Universe are H, He, C, N, O, thus we have the expectation that
the most common molecules are made from these atoms.  However,
the bonds between molecules is very weak (look how easy it is to breakdown
water) and interstellar space is full of UV and x-ray photons which can
break these bonds.  So interstellar molecules are only found in the dark
centers of dense nebula of gas and dust.<p>

Just as electrons orbit around the nucleus in quantized energy states,
atoms can rotate around each other, also in quantized speeds.  Changes
in the rotation, by collisions or interactions, will emit photons.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/molecular_radiation.gif"></center><p>

Radiation from interstellar molecules is a good tracer of the dense,
thick regions of the interstellar medium.  These dense regions are
usually the sites of protostar formation and collapse of large clouds of
gas to form into star clusters.<p>

<hr noshade><p>

<u>Interstellar Dust</u>:<p>

Interstellar dust is produced in the envelopes around red supergiant
stars.  Stellar winds and the planetary nebula phase eject this dust
into the interstellar medium.  Dust particles are mostly carbon and
silicate grains that are a few microns in size.  Although small, they
completely absorb any light that strikes them and are heated by
collisions with gas molecules.  They will be warmed to the ambient
temperature of the surrounding region and re-radiate that energy in the
far infrared.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/interstellar_dust.gif"></center><p>

Although solid objects, dust grains are not immune to destruction.  Collisions with high speed gas particles, UV photons and other grains will
breakdown dust grains.  For this reason, dust is only found in the cores
of dark nebula where they are shielded from destructive effects.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/sputtering.gif"></center><p>

Dust grains serve as sites for the formation of molecules and organic
compounds.  Their cold surfaces act as catalysts by allowing atoms to
stick to them so there there is time for a second atom to land,
interact, and form a molecule. Collections of dust and molecular gases
are called molecular clouds.<p>

<hr noshade><p>

<u>Dark Nebula</u>:<p>

We divide the interstellar medium into three types dependent on their
temperature (called the phase of the interstellar medium): cold (10's
K), warm (100 to 1000's K), hot (millions K).  The colder a cloud of gas, the
more of its output emission is in the long wavelengths; radio and
microwave.  Hot regions of interstellar gas are bright in their own
optical emission.<p>

Note also that the various temperatures determine the type of matter
that will exist.  Cold temperatures are suitable to the formation of
molecules.  Warmer temperatures will find only atoms, such as neutral
hydrogen.  Under higher temperatures, atoms become ionized (HII
regions).  The coldest regions of space are the dark nebula.<p>

Some dark nebula are found through star counts, such as the Coalsack.
Others are visible because an emission nebula is behind them, so they
are illuminated from behind, such as the Horse Head Nebula shown
below.  This happens often because the same gas that is associated with
the dark nebula can also be heated by nearby stars to glow as an
emission nebula.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/horse_head_nebula.gif"></center><p>

The Horse Head Nebula is several tens of parsecs across and would
envelop the local neighborhood of stars around our solar system.  Stars
seen in the image are foreground stars since the nebula is opaque.<p>

Some dark nebula are surrounded by emission regions, giving the
impression that the dark cores are being dissolved by the hotter gas as
in the Eagle Nebula shown below.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/hst_eagle.jpg"></center><p>

A great deal of information is contained in the above image, the
irregular shape of the dark regions, the hot vapor off the edges heated
by nearby stars, the straight rays of dissolved gas.  This nebula
indicates that the interaction between dark nebula and bright, hot gas
is dynamic and ongoing.<p>

<hr noshade><p>

<u>Molecular Clouds</u>:<p>

Often in the centers of dark nebula are dense concentrations of gas and
dust called molecular clouds.  They are called molecular because the
temperatures are so low (only a few 10's K) that H<sub>2</sub> and CO
can form on the surface of dust grains.  Dense gas makes for instability
to gravity, and large pieces of the cloud can collapse to form
protostars.  Thus, molecular clouds are important as `nurseries' for
young star clusters.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/molecular_cloud.gif"></center><p>

Molecular clouds are probed with far infrared and sub-millimeter
telescopes to study the conditions that lead to star formation and the
details of protostar evolution.  As the young stars evolve and heat the
leftover gas, the molecular cloud will be destroyed and turned into a
HII region such as the Orion Nebula.<p>

A perspective plot of the location of molecular clouds towards the
center of the Galaxy is shown below. The location of the Sagittarius and
Scutum spiral arms are clearly outlined.<p>

<center><img src="../../images/mw_molecular.gif"></center><p>

There are many processes that go on inside a molecular cloud that can
enhance or inhibit the formation of stars.  For example, turbulence in
the core of a cloud would compress some regions and enhance star
formation.  Magnetic fields would retard the collapse of a cloud and
slow down the production of new stars.<p>
