    October 23rd is a very exciting day in my chemistry classes.  We plan for the big day for a

    week in advance, the students practice mole songs, plan the menu, and work on stuffed moles.

    But once the day gets here and they have found the hidden moles throughout the school, we

    have eaten the "mole food", made a toast to the mole with a mole of water and sang a few

    songs, we have some down time.  That is the reason I decided to create a game; "Who Wants to

    be a Moleionaire?" to be exact!  The game is a Powerpoint presentation with 6 complete games.

    Each game begins with directions, how fastest finger will work etc... and you work your way

    through 6 questions to become a moleionaire!  You can continue on to the next game which

    begins with the fastest finger question again or only do one game per class.

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

    I have a display board that goes along with the game, and have included the files that contain

    

    most of my graphics.  The display board allows me to keep track of any lifelines used by a

    student and how many mole dollars they have earned after each correct answer.

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

    I am very anxious to use it on October 23 of 2001 for the Molar Odyssey, and I'm pleased to

    share it with all the other chemistry teachers out there!  Please e-mail me with any questions,

    comments or suggestions.  I'm sure there will be at least one mistake in there somewhere!

    Also, if you'd like to change the questions to better fit your students or classes, please

    do so.  And again, if you have any suggestions to improve the game, please send them my way!

    Enjoy and have a wonderful Mole Day!

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

    Note:  I was a recipient of the Maury Award given by the National Mole Day Foundation.  I

    applied for the grant to create the "Who Wants to be a Moleionaire?" game, and to purchase

    supplies to make stuffed moles with each of my students.  I am curious to see the variety of

    moles that will come to school on October 23!  Visit the National Mole Day Foundation

    website at <a href="http://www.moleday.org">www.moleday.org</a> to get more information about

    the grant and mole day in general!
