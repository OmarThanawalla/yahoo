      <i>Computational Vision</i>
can be thought of as enabling computers to use visual information. Like
many problems in Artificial Intelligence, it's something people do so
easily they barely think about it, but a very complex problem for a
machine. <p>Our primary focus in the Vision Lab at SFU is in
understanding colour: How are colours perceived? How can colours be
reproduced accurately on different media? In what ways does colour help
in understanding images? Understanding colour is a much more difficult
problem than most people suspect. Often poor colour rendition results
more from our limited understanding of colour perception than it does
from limitations of our colour producing devices. </p><p>We subscribe to a computational view of colour; namely,
that human perception and use of colour can be explored and explained
as computations. The fundamental problem of colour is to explain how we
see colours as relatively stable despite the fact that the light
reflected into our eyes from an object varies dramatically with the
light illuminating the object. Colour and computers have become much
more intertwined in recent years as colour displays and colour printers
have become more affordable. Since colour is a perceptual, not a
physical quality, it is crucial to have a good model of how we perceive
colour in complex environments if we are to get predictable results
from these devices. </p><p>Colours are difficult to reproduce correctly, but why?
While we've all experienced untrue colour while using home video
cameras or viewing prints from our local photofinisher, now we have
colour printers frustrating us with colours that look very little like
the nice colours we previewed on our LCD display. When the colour
doesn't look right, it's natural to feel that the printer and display
are not calibrated properly--- and of course perhaps they're not--- but
that's not the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem stems from
the fact that colour reproduction, simply is not a matter of
reproducing identical physical phenomena, as it is in the case of sound
reproduction in which a similar pattern of sound waves is recreated,
but rather a matter of creating perceptual equivalences. </p><p>For us to build machines that reproduce colours
accurately or to make effective use of colour in robotics requires that
we understand human colour perception; and the last decade has produced
many interesting new computational theories of colour coming from both
computer science and psychology. A central concern of these theories is
to describe how colour depends or does not depend on the incident
illumination. A coloured surface cannot be seen unless we shine some
light on it, but the spectrum of the reflected light depends on the
product of the spectrum of the incident light's spectrum and the
surface's reflectance. It's natural to think of a surface's colour as a
feature of the surface itself, but the spectrum of the light energy
reaching the eye has the two factors of illumination and reflectance
confounded into one. In order to determine the true surface properties,
the effect of the illumination must be taken into account. </p></td></tr>

<p> In the upper left is the image of a scene taken under an orangish,
tungsten light which has the effect of turning the background overly
green and the whites a bit yellow. In the bottom right is the target
image of the same scene but under the standard illumination for which
the camera is calibrated. Since we cannot always control the
illumination, our goal is to correct automatically the colours in the
input image so that they will look like those in the target
image. (The fuzziness of the images is due to a high JPEG compression
factor--- concentrate on the colours.)

</p><p> The top right is a 'corrected' image produced by the standard
grey-world colour balancing algorithm, which assumes that the average
of all the colours in the scene is grey.  In the bottom left is the
much better result produced by our new, more sophisticated algorithm
developed in the Vision Lab.  As you can see, the result of our new
algorithm is much closer to the target image than that produced by
the grey-world algorithm.
