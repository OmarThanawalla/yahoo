<p>
Researchers in the Center for Relativity are involved in the study
of gravitation in both the classical and quantum regimes. 
<p>
The main
emphasis in the group is on astrophysical applications of General
Relativity (GR), using computers to simulate binary black holes and
other relativistic objects.  One principal goal of this work is to
accurately model sources of gravitational waves, to eventually provide
"template" waveforms for use in the data analysis of signals measured
at observatories like LIGO.  Interpreting these signals provides
insight into the earliest epochs of the universe, and the deepest
parts compact objects, available to any observational technique.
We make use of substantial computing resources both at UT and around
the country, and many purely computational problems are worthy of
pursuit within the context of our group's research.  Students
interested in computational physics and/or astrophysics are
particularly encouraged to participate.

<p>
In addition to numerical
studies, students in the group are investigating the structure of
Einstein's (10 coupled, nonlinear partial differential) equations
from a purely mathematical standpoint as well, including questions
about constraint propagation and boundary conditions which are at
the forefront of research in the field. 

<p>
Finally we have students
working toward a quantum theory of gravitation, via avenues such as
alternate actions for canonical quantization of gravity.

<p>

We are always willing to welcome new collaborators!<br>
