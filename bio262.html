Cytoplasm is basically the substance that fills the cell.
It is a jelly-like material that  is eighty percent water
and usually clear in color.  It is more like a viscous
(thick) gel than a watery substance, but it liquefies when
shaken or stirred.  Cytoplasm, which can also be referred to
as cytosol, means cell substance.  This name is very fitting
because cytoplasm is the substance of life that serves as a
molecular soup in which all of the cell's organelles are
suspended and held together by a fatty membrane.  The
cytoplasm is found inside the cell membrane, surrounding the
nuclear envelope and the cytoplasmic organelles.

The cytoplasm, as seen through an electron microscope,
appears as a three-dimensional lattice of thin protein-rich
strands.  These lattices are known as microtrabecular
lattice (MTL) and serves to interconnect and support the
other "solid" structures in the cytoplasm.  In other words,
the cytoplasm is like a fence that is made up of lattes that
are connected together.  This fence's main purpose is to
hold together the organelles within the cytoplasm.

Cytoplasm is the home of the cytoskeleton, a network of
cytoplasmic filaments that are responsible for the movement
of the cell and give the cell its shape.  The cytoplasm
contains dissolved nutrients and helps dissolve waste
products. The cytoplasm helps materials move around the cell
by moving and churning through a process called cytoplasmic
streaming. The nucleus often flows with the cytoplasm
changing the shape as it moves.  The cytoplasm contains many
salts and is an excellent conductor of electricity, which
therefore creates a medium for the vesicles, or mechanics of
the cell.  The function of the cytoplasm and the organelles
which sit in it, are critical the cell's survival.
