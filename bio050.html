One astrocyte may envelop some of the synapses of several neurons, and one neuron may have its synapses enveloped by several astrocytes. This theory proposes that the neurotransmitter-tropic filopodial response of astrocytes and/or activity related astrocytic swelling in vitro also occur in vivo where they provide a mechanism that mediates the astrocytic envelopment and segregation of synapses. Just as the extent of filopodial growth in vitro is dependent on neurotransmitter concentration and exposure time and the degree of swelling is dependent on extracellular ionic concentrations, the extent of astrocytic envelopment of synapses in vivo depends on the synapses' firing history. An astrocyte would thus be expected to change its envelopment of individual synapses within the total population of enveloped synapses based on the relative firing frequencies of each synapse.

							</tbody></table><font>Nearly 30 years ago, Katz and Miledi (<a name="Anchor-15-60133"></a><a href="#Anchor-Katz-53283">15</a>) demonstrated that the amount of neurotransmitter released from presynaptic terminals in response to a propagated action potential was related to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the synaptic cleft. This relationship was hypothesized to be nonlinear, with synaptic release proportional to the fourth power of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<a name="Anchor-16-46384"></a><a href="#Anchor-Dodge-30815">16</a>). Thus, small changes in synaptic cleft [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] may have relatively large effects on synaptic transmission; indeed, this concept has received recent support (<a name="Anchor-17-30408"></a><a href="#Anchor-Bennett-41681">17</a>, <a name="Anchor-18-17761"></a><a href="#Anchor-Ravin-30189">18</a>). Astrocytes that envelop synapses, it is proposed, are able to control synaptic cleft [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] throughmechanisms of the astrocytic calcium wave. Two major events occurring during the astrocytic calcium wave have recently been described (<a href="#Anchor-Cornell-Bell-3800">1</a>,<a href="#Anchor-Cornell-Bell-44867">2</a>): liberation of intracellular protein bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the astrocytic cytoplasm and simultaneous uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the astrocytes' extracellular environment. Indirect evidence also suggests the return of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the extracellular space upon termination of the calcium wave (<a href="#Anchor-Cornell-Bell-3800">1</a>). In vivo, astrocytes' ability to rapidly reduce and restore Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the synaptic clefts they envelop affords them control of neurotransmitter release and, therefore, control of neurotransmission itself (Fig. 1b,c).</font>

						<p><font>It is unlikely that sufficient neurotransmitter would be released at one astrocytically enveloped synapse to provoke a calcium wave in the enveloping astrocyte. One astrocyte, however, can envelop many synapses in vivo. Thus, if calcium waves occur in vivo within the cortex, coordinated exposure to neurotransmitters at many of the synapses one astrocyte controls could be sufficient to trigger calcium wave production. A reciprocal relationship would then be established between an astrocyte and the synapses it envelops. The astrocyte controls neurotransmitter release through calcium wave modulation of synaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and an astrocytic calcium wave is precipitated in turn by coordinated neurotransmitter release at the many synapses that the astrocyte envelops.</font></p>

							</tbody></table><font>These interdependent astrocytic and neuronal events are summarized in Figs. 1b, c and 2. In the absence of either a presynaptic action potential or an astrocytic calcium wave, a high level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is available within the extracellular space of the synaptic cleft (Fig. 1b). An action potential arriving at the presynaptic terminal opens the terminal's calcium channels. Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters the terminal and facilitates neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft (Fig 1c). The released neurotransmitter activates the postsynaptic terminal. Simultaneously, the astrocyte enveloping the synapse is also exposed to the released neurotransmitter resulting in two consequences: 1) the "infotropic" response of the astrocyte is activated, moving the enveloping astrocyte's surface closer to the highest concentration of neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft; 2) if the [neurotransmitter] threshold of the astrocyte is exceeded, a calcium wave is generated. </font>

Decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the cleft inhibits further neurotransmitter release, despite the arrival of action potentials (Fig 2b). Only with cessation of the astrocytic calcium wave will Ca<sup>2+</sup> return to its original level in the synaptic cleft allowing neurotransmitter release at high levels.</font></p>

							</tbody></table><font>By simultaneously regulating neurotransmission in all of the synapses an astrocyte has enveloped, the astrocytic calcium wave may coordinate synapses into synchronously firing groups. Thus, all of the synapses enveloped or partially enveloped by an astrocyte may be within that astrocyte's <em>domain of synaptic influence</em>.<br />
							Fig. 3a illustrates an astrocyte and many of the synapses it envelops. Initiation of a calcium wave in this astrocyte occurs when a sufficient number of presynaptic terminals within its domain of influence release neurotransmitter simultaneously, exposing the astrocyte to suprathreshold stimulation (Fig 3b). During the astrocyte's calcium wave all the synaptic extracellular space within its domain undergoes a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, inhibiting neurotransmitter release and neurotransmission throughout the astrocyte's entire domain of influence (Fig. 3c). Termination of the calcium wave shifts Ca<sup>2+</sup> back into all the synaptic clefts simultaneously. Although calcium channels in each of the synapses within the domain may have opened at different times, the sudden, simultaneous availability of increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> to all opened channels might be expected to phase lock and synchronize neurotransmitter release. Synchronous neurotransmission throughout the entire domain would be expected as the astrocyte's calcium wave is reinitiated (Fig 3d). Such synchronous neurotransmission, it is hypothesized, might occur at relatively high frequencies in vivo because astrocytes at room temperature in vitro can generate calcium wave oscillations with frequencies of several times per minute (<a href="#Anchor-Cornell-Bell-3800">1</a>, <a href="#Anchor-Cornell-Bell-44867">2</a>, <a href="#Anchor-Nedergaard-21683">3</a>, <a name="Anchor-20-54325"></a><a href="#Anchor-Charles-43266">20</a>).</font> </div>

						<h4><font><strong>Astrocyte Connections Allow Expanded Control of Synapses</strong></font></h4>
					</td>
					<td><font>Astrocytes are connected to each other by unidirectional gap junctions that allow the exchange of many biologically important molecules (<a name="Anchor-21-53377"></a><a href="#Anchor-Robinson-57">21</a>, <a name="Anchor-22-42424"></a><a href="#Anchor-Rash-58500">22</a>). Astrocyte to astrocyte unidirectional transfer of unbound cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurs through gap junctions during calcium wave generation (<a name="Anchor-23-39842"></a><a href="#Anchor-Finkbeiner-58644">23</a>). The presence of unbound Ca<sup>2+</sup> within astrocytic cytoplasm is known to facilitate calcium wave activation (<a name="Anchor-23-39842"></a><a href="#Anchor-Finkbeiner-58644">23</a>). Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3), which is important in the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores (<a name="Anchor-24-59060"></a><a href="#Anchor-Berridge-45980">24</a>), has also been hypothesized to move through gap junctions and play a role in intracellular calcium wave activation and intercellular calcium wave propagation (<a name="Anchor-25-4711"></a><a href="#Anchor-Sanderson-28250">25</a>). Sequential intercellular propagation of calcium waves may occur as a consequence of the relative combined effects of intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and/or InsP3 transmission and coincident neurotransmitter stimulation from overlapping domains of synaptic influence. Varieties of calcium wave propagation supporting these contentions have been observed in monolayer and organotypic culture preparations (<a href="#Anchor-Cornell-Bell-44867">2</a>, <a href="#Anchor-Dani-59404">19</a>, <a name="Anchor-23-39842"></a><a href="#Anchor-Finkbeiner-58644">23</a>). A group of astrocytes acting as a single cell or syncytium may, through the generation of a pervasive calcium wave, control and synchronize the firing patterns of synapses of a great many neurons. This putative coupling of astrocytic and synaptic function implies that the initiation of a calcium wave by a subgroup of synapses within the domain should inhibit neurotransmitter release throughout the entire domain, and this initiation should effect a secondary neurotransmission synchrony in the domain's larger group of synapses. This final array of synchronously firing synapses would be related only in part to the synapses initiating the calcium wave. </font>
						<p><font>At a rate equal to the generation of the astrocyte's calcium wave, the astrocyte would be expected to infotropically increase its influence on the initiating synapses of the subgroup by drawing closer to them, decreasing their extracellular perisynaptic spaces. These decreases in the perisynaptic spaces would not only increase the astrocyte's ability to control extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> but would also, by increasing concentration of released neurotransmitter within a now more restricted synaptic cleft, increase the synapses' efficiency in provoking a calcium wave. Such an activity-dependent change in the astrocytic calcium wave response, apparently being potentiated by previous episodes of activity in nearby synapses, has recently been demonstrated in situ (<a href="#Anchor-Pasti-17304">5</a>). This reciprocating relationship might enable an even smaller subgroup of presynaptic terminals within the astrocyte's domain to precipitate a calcium wave, in turn affecting neurotransmission within the entire domain of synapses.</font></p>
						<p><font>After the pervasive and synchronous neurotransmitter release throughout the astrocyte's domain of influence, a calcium wave is again initiated. A reciprocating relationship between calcium wave activation and synchronous neurotransmitter release would be expected to continue as long as enough presynaptic terminals are releasing sufficient quanta of neurotransmitter to exceed the astrocyte's calcium wave threshold. The frequencies of these astrocytic-synaptic oscillations would be dependent upon and reflective of both the character and duration of the initiating stimuli. </font></p>
						<p><font>From this vantage, this theory proposes that sensory information is encrypted by associative cortex in patterns of synchronous synaptic firing that are determined by varying patterns of astrocytic syncytia. Astrocytic-synaptic oscillations occur at various frequencies for various periods of time. The spatial patterns, frequencies and duration of these oscillations are dependent on both the sensory input creating them and the influences of pre-established astrocytic domains of influence.</font></p>

						<h4><font><strong>The Input Changes the Hardware</strong></font></h4>
					</td>
					<td><font>It has traditionally been held that associative cortical integration of sensory input is accomplished purely through utilization of complex networks of neuronal connections. The theory presented here, however, contends that the associative areas of brain include plastic, motile astrocytes that participate in the encoding and manipulation of information by organizing and controlling groups of synapses. Sensory information that began its journey as neuronal action potentials eventually reaches areas of the central nervous system in patterns that activate astrocytic calcium waves. According to the theory, activated astrocytes in turn infotropically encode the information with resulting synchronously firing synaptic domains. The character of the synaptic domains reflects the primary perceived sensory information at any moment in time, but the pools of synchronous synapses are modified by the presentation of novel information. Through the mechanism of infotropic astrocytic movement, metaphorically speaking, `the input changes the hardware.'</font> 
						<p><font>The theory predicts that repetitive, identical activation patterns of sensory cortices will be mirrored in repetitive infotropic responses of associative cortical astrocytes and the creation of representational domains of influence. Because each synapse and astrocyte may participate in a host of infotropically encoded patterns which reflect the character, duration and chronology of sensory input, individual synaptic or astrocytic activations have deterministic meaning only in the context of their place in activation sequences.</font></p>

						<h4><font><strong>Is Epilepsy an Astrocytic Disorder?</strong></font></h4>
					</td>
					<td><font>No universally accepted hypothesis has yet been offered that explains the varieties of rhythmic and synchronous neuronal firing that define epileptic seizures. Many investigators have suggested, however, that astroglia play a significant role in epilepsy (<a name="Anchor-26-46282"></a><a href="#Anchor-Ransom-11306">26</a>, <a name="Anchor-27-8389"></a><a href="#Anchor-White-23269">27</a>, <a name="Anchor-28-37448"></a><a href="#Anchor-Heineman-51689">28</a>). This theory allows for synchronous neuronal firing involving the domains of many astrocytes acting as a syncytium. A calcium wave produced by millions of astrocytes acting as a syncytium would, at the wave's termination, be expected to result in the synchronous firing of neurons in large regions of the brain. The widespread, coordinated release of neurotransmitter would then precipitate a second equally pervasive calcium wave in the astrocytic syncytium, which again would effect synchronous neuronal firing, and so on, resulting in the synchronous and rhythmic neuronal firing characteristic of the epileptic seizure. Epilepsy, this theory contends, is primarily a disorder of astrocytes caused by pathological, high frequency syncytial calcium waves preceding and modulating a consequential neuronal synchrony. Varieties of seizures, according to this theory, are dependent on the extent and character of the pathologically large astrocytic syncytia producing them.</font> 
						<p><font>The partial complex seizures of childhood known as <em>petit mal</em> may provide an example of the astrocytic etiology of epilepsy. <em>Petit mal</em> seizures can often be provoked by hyperventilation (for example, by having a child blow repeatedly on a pinwheel). After several minutes of hyperventilating the pH of the child's blood becomes slightly alkaline as a consequence of the respiratory depletion of carbon dioxide. With this shift toward the alkaline, the <em>petit mal</em> seizure begins as evidenced by a characteristic three-per-second spike-wave pattern on the electroencephalogram. In addition to their many other roles, astrocytes near the capillaries of cerebral cortex envelop these blood vessels with their cytoplasmic extensions. The exposure of these perivascular astrocytes, which also control synaptic domains of influence, to the sudden alkaline shift in the blood may result in primary perivascular calcium wave activation and secondary perivascular synaptic synchrony. Indeed, the three-per-second spike-wave pattern seen on the electroencephalogram may reflect the synaptic (spike) and astrocytic (wave) oscillations the theory proposes, with unusually high frequency calcium waves resulting from the effects of alkalosis combined with secondarily coordinated neurotransmitter release. Of additional interest is the demonstration that many of the medications used in the treatment of epilepsy are astrocytic calcium wave inhibitors (<a name="Anchor-29-41648"></a><a href="#Anchor-White-34289">29</a>, <a name="Anchor-30-7189"></a><a href="#Anchor-Nilsson-54980">30</a>).</font></p>

The astrocytic calcium waves so produced would be unrelated to, and for a while unresponsive to the influence of, normal sensory input. Meaningful interactions between astrocytes and synapses could be overwhelmed by the disruptively nonsensical mechanically induced calcium wave patterns. Despite the inability of the mechanical force to produce macro or microscopic injury, the brain -- the person -- would be "knocked out" or temporarily unconscious.</font>

					<td><font>A similar unconscious state in which the cellular elements of associative cortex cannot respond normally to sensory input could, according to the theory, result from astrocytic gap junction blockade. Without functional gap junctions, astrocytes become unable to transmit their control of synchronous synaptic firing through the cortex. Because astrocytes cannot form syncytia, their control is restricted to only the synapses within their individual domains of influence. Several general anesthetics have been demonstrated to be reversible gap junction blockers (<a href="#Anchor-Robinson-57">21</a>, <a name="Anchor-31-4581"></a><a href="#Anchor-Mantz-43914">31</a>).</font>

						<h4><font><strong>Does Memory Depend on the Neuron-Astrocyte Relationship?</strong></font></h4>
					</td>
					<td><font>Many authors have speculated on the involvement of astrocytes in memory and CNS plasticity (<a name="Anchor-32-48213"></a><a href="#Anchor-Smith-6296">32</a>, <a name="Anchor-33-23522"></a><a href="#Anchor-Muller-37516">33</a>). The neuron-astrocyte theory here, however, proposes that the infotropic character of astrocytes is crucial to the cellular basis of associative memory. Also, <em>neuroplasticity</em> may more properly be termed <em>neuronal-astrocytic plasticity</em>, with the astrocytes' capacity to influence groups of synapses compromised only by the degree to which they have already organized these groups. Biological imprinting that occurs within defined critical periods of many species might represent a more permanent infotropically mediated astrocytic organization of synaptic domains. This premise is supported by the work of Muller and Best (<a name="Anchor-34-30797"></a><a href="#Anchor-Muller-60059">34</a>), who reinduced ocular-dominance plasticity in adult animals by supplementing the adult visual cortex with astrocytes cultured from the visual cortex of newborn animals.</font>

						<h3><font><strong>Concluding<br />
						Remarks</strong></font></h3>
					</td>
					<td><font>The neuron-astrocyte theory challenges the notion that neuronal networks alone, no matter how complex, can explain the many normal and pathological aspects of brain function. This model, in which motile astrocytes organize and modulate synaptic activity, may permit widely divergent aspects of brain function and pathology to be viewed from a single theoretical vantage. Testing key aspects of this theory, i.e., astrocytic movement in vivo and astrocytic control of neurotransmission in vivo, will present significant technical challenges. When these challenges are overcome, however, we may learn significant new lessons about cortical function, its cellular substrates, and the mechanisms by which it is compromised in a variety of disease states.</font>
