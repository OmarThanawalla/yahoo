<p>Chaos Theory<br>
<a href="#The Division of Labour">The Division of Labour</a><br>

<p>Dialectical materialism, elaborated by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, was concerned
with much more than political economy: it was a world view. Nature, as Engels in
particular sought to demonstrate in his writings, is proof of the correctness of both
materialism and dialectics. &quot;My recapitulation of mathematics and the natural
sciences,&quot; he wrote, &quot;was undertaken in order to convince myself also in detail&#133;that
in nature amid the welter of innumerable changes, the same dialectical laws of motion
force their way through as those which in history govern the apparent fortuitousness of
events&#133;&quot; (16) </p>

<p>Since their day, every important new advance in scientific discovery has confirmed the
Marxian outlook although scientists, because of the political implications of an
association with Marxism, seldom acknowledge dialectical materialism. Now, the advent of
chaos theory provides fresh backing for the fundamental ideas of the founders of
scientific socialism. Up to now chaos has been largely ignored by scientists, except as a
nuisance or something to be avoided. A tap drips, sometimes regularly, sometimes not; the
movement of a fluid is either turbulent or not; the heart beats regularly but sometimes
goes into a fibrillation; the weather blows hot or cold. Wherever there is motion that
appears to be chaotic&#151;and it is all around us&#151;there is generally little attempt
to come to terms with it from a strictly scientific point of view. </p>

<p>What then, are the general features of chaotic systems? Having described them in
mathematical terms, what application does the mathematics have? One of the features given
prominence by Gleick and others is what has been dubbed &quot;the butterfly effect.&quot;
Lorenz, had discovered on his computer-simulated weather a remarkable development. One of
his simulations was based on twelve variables, including, as we said, non-linear
relationships. He found that if he started his simulation with values that were only
slightly different from the original&#151;the difference being that one set were down to
six decimal places and the second set down three places&#151;then the &quot;weather&quot;
produced by the computer soon veered wildly from the original. Where perhaps a slight
perturbation might have been expected, there was, only after a brief period of
recognisable similarity, a completely different pattern. </p>

<p>This means that in a complex, non-linear system, a small change in the input could
produce a huge change in the output. In Lorenz&#146;s computer world, it was equivalent to
a butterfly&#146;s wing-beat causing a hurricane in another part of the world; hence the
expression. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that, given the complexity of
the forces and processes that go to determine the weather, it can never be predicted
beyond a short period of time ahead. In fact, the biggest weather computer in the world,
in the European centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting, does as many as 400 million
calculations every second. It is fed 100 million separate weather measurements from around
the world every day, and it processes data in three hours of continuous running, to
produce a ten day forecast. Yet beyond two or three days the forecasts are speculative,
and beyond six or seven they are worthless. Chaos theory, then, sets definite limits to
the predictability of complex non-linear systems. </p>

<p>It is strange, nevertheless, that Gleick and others have paid so much attention to the
butterfly effect, as if it injects a strange mystique into chaos theory. It is surely well
established (if not accurately modelled mathematically) that in other similarly complex
systems a small input can produce a large output, that an accumulation of
&quot;quantity&quot; can be transformed to &quot;quality.&quot; There is only a difference
of less than two per cent, for example, in the basic genetic make-up of human beings and
chimpanzees&#151;a difference that can be quantified in terms of molecular chemistry. Yet
in the complex, non-linear processes that are involved in translating the genetic
&quot;code&quot; into a living animal, this small dissimilarity means the difference
between one species and another. </p>

<p>Marxism applies itself to perhaps the most complex of all non-linear systems&#151;human
society. With the colossal interaction of countless individuals, politics and economics
constitute so complex a system that alongside it, the planet&#146;s weather systems looks
like clockwork. Nevertheless, as is the case with other &quot;chaotic&quot; systems,
society can be treated scientifically&#151;as long as the limits, like the weather, are
understood. Unfortunately, Gleick&#146;s book is not clear on the application of chaos
theory to politics and economics. He cites an exercise by Mandelbrot, who fed his IBM
computer with a hundred year&#146;s worth of cotton prices from the New York exchange.
&quot;Each particular price change was random and unpredictable,&quot; he writes.
&quot;But the sequence of changes was independent of scale: curves for daily and monthly
price changes matched&#133;the degree of variation had remained constant over a tumultuous
60-year period that saw two world wars and a depression.&quot; (17) </p>

<p>This passage cannot be taken on face value. It may be true that within certain limits,
it is possible to see the same mathematical patterns that have been identified in other
models or chaotic systems. But given the almost limitless complexity of human society and
economics, it is inconceivable that major events like wars would not disrupt these
patterns. Marxists would argue that society does lend itself to scientific study. In
contrast to those who see only formlessness, Marxists see human development from the
starting point of material forces, and a scientific description of social categories like
classes, and so on. If the development of chaos science leads to an acceptance that the
scientific method is valid in politics and economics, then it is a valuable plus. However,
as Marx and Engels have always understood, theirs is an inexact science, meaning that
broad trends and developments could be traced, but detailed and intimate knowledge of all
influences and conditions is not possible. </p>

<p>Cotton prices notwithstanding, the book gives no evidence that this Marxist view is
wrong. In fact, there is no explanation as to why Mandelbrot apparently saw a pattern in
only 60 years&#146; prices when he had over 100 years&#146; of data to play with. In
addition, elsewhere in the book, Gleick adds that &quot;economists have looked for strange
attractors in stock market trends but so far had not found them.&quot; Despite the
apparent limitations in the fields of economics and politics, however, it is clear that
the mathematical &quot;taming&quot; of what were thought to be random or chaotic systems
has profound implications for science as a whole. It opens up many vistas for the study of
processes that were largely out of bounds in the past. </p>

<p><strong><a name="The Division of Labour">Division of Labour</a> </strong></p>

<p>One of the main characteristics of the great scientists of the Renaissance was that
they were whole human beings. They had an all-rounded development, which enabled, for
example, Leonardo da Vinci to be a great engineer, mathematician and mechanician, as well
as an artist of genius. The same was true of Dï¿½hrer, Machiavelli, Luther, and countless
others, of whom Engels wrote: </p>

<p>&quot;The heroes of that time were not yet in thrall to the division of labour, the
restricting effects of which, with its production of one-sidedness, we so often notice in
their successors.&quot; (18) The division of labour, of course, plays a necessary role in
the development of the productive forces. However, under capitalism, this has been carried
to such an extreme that it begins to turn into its opposite. </p>

<p>The extreme division, on the one hand, between mental and manual labour means that
millions of men and women are reduced to a life of unthinking drudgery on the production
line, denied of any possibility to display the creativity and inventiveness which is
latent in every human being. At the other extreme, we have the development of a kind of
intellectual priestly caste which has arrogated to itself the sole right to the title of
&quot;guardians of science and culture.&quot; To the degree that these people become
remote from the real life of society, this has a negative effect on their consciousness.
They develop in an entirely narrow, one-sided way. Not only is there an abyss separating
&quot;artists&quot; from scientists, but the scientific community itself is riven with
ever-increasing divisions between increasingly narrow specialisations. It is ironic that,
precisely when the &quot;lines of demarcation&quot; between physics, chemistry and biology
are breaking down, the gulf which divides even different branches of, say, physics has
become virtually unbridgeable. </p>

<p>James Gleick describes the situation thus: </p>

<p>&quot;Few laymen realise how tightly compartmentalised the scientific community had
become, a battleship with bulkheads sealed against leaks. Biologists had enough to read
without keeping up with the mathematical literature&#151;for that matter, molecular
biologists had enough to read without keeping up with population biology, physicists had
better ways to spend their time than sifting through the meteorology journals.&quot; </p>

<p>In recent years, the advent of chaos theory is one of the indications that something is
beginning to change in the scientific community. Increasingly, scientists from different
fields feel that they have somehow reached a dead end. It is necessary to break out in a
new direction. The birth of chaos mathematics, therefore, is a proof as Engels would have
said, of the dialectical character of nature, a reminder that reality consists of whole
dynamic systems, or even one whole system, and not of models (however useful) abstracted
from them. What are the main features of chaos theory? Gleick describes them in the
following way: </p>

<p>&quot;To some physicists, chaos is a science of process rather than state, of becoming
rather than being.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;They feel that they are turning back a trend in science towards reductionism, the
analysis of systems in terms of their constituent parts: quarks, chromosomes, or neutrons.
They believe that they are looking for the whole.&quot; </p>

<p>The method of dialectical materialism is precisely to look at &quot;process rather than
state, of becoming rather than being.&quot; &quot;More and more over the past decade, he&#146;d
begun to sense that the old reductionist approaches were reaching a dead end, and that
even some of the hard-core physical scientists were getting fed up with mathematical
abstractions that ignored the real complexities of the world. They seemed to be
half-consciously groping for a new approach&#151;and in the process, he thought, they were
cutting across the traditional boundaries in a way they hadn&#146;t done in years. Maybe
centuries.&quot; (19) </p>

<p>Because chaos is a science of whole dynamic systems, rather than separate parts, it
represents, in effect, an unacknowledged vindication of the dialectical view. Up to now,
scientific investigation has been too much isolated into its constituent parts. In pursuit
of the &quot;parts&quot; the scientific specialist becomes too specialised not
infrequently losing all sight of the &quot;whole.&quot; Experimentation and theoretical
rationalisations thus became increasingly removed from reality. More than a century ago,
Engels criticised the narrowness of what he called the metaphysical method, which
consisted of looking at things in an isolated way, which lost sight of the whole. The
starting point of the supporters of chaos theory was a reaction against precisely this
method, which they call &quot;reductionism.&quot; Engels explained that the
&quot;reduction&quot; of the study of nature to separate disciplines is to some extent
necessary and inevitable. </p>

<p>&quot;When we reflect on nature or the history of mankind or our own intellectual
activity, at first we see the picture of an endless maze of connections in which nothing
remains what, where and as it was, but everything moves, changes, comes into being and
passes away&#133; </p>

<p>&quot;But this conception, correctly as it expresses the general character of the
picture of phenomena as a whole, does not suffice to explain the details of which this
picture is made up, and so long as we cannot do this, we are not clear about the whole
picture. In order to understand these details we must detach them from their natural or
historical connection and examine each one separately according to its nature, special
causes and effects, etc.&quot; </p>

<p>But as Engels warned, too great a retreat into &quot;reductionism&quot; can lead to an
undialectical view, or a drift to metaphysical ideas. </p>

<p>&quot;The analysis of nature into its individual parts, the division of the different
natural processes and objects into definite classes, the study of the internal anatomy of
organic bodies in their manifold forms&#151;these were the fundamental conditions for the
gigantic strides in our knowledge of nature that have been made during the last four
hundred years. But this has bequeathed us the habit of observing natural objects and
processes in isolation, detached from the general context; of observing them not in their
motion, but in their state of rest; not as essentially variable elements, but as constant
ones; not in their life, but in their death.&quot; (20) </p>

<p>Now compare this with the following passage from Gleick&#146;s book: </p>

<p>&quot;Scientists break things apart and look at them one at a time. If they want to
examine the interaction of subatomic particles, they put two or three together. There is
complication enough. The power of self-similarity, though, begins at much greater levels
of complexity. It is a matter of looking at the whole.&quot; (21) </p>

<p>If we substitute the word &quot;reductionism&quot; for &quot;the metaphysical mode of
thought,&quot; we see that the central idea is identical. Now see what conclusion Engels
drew from his criticism of reductionism (&quot;the metaphysical method&quot;): </p>

<p>&quot;But for dialectics, which grasps things and their images, ideas, essentially in
their interconnection, in their sequence, their movement, their birth and death, such
processes as those mentioned above are so many corroborations of its own method of
treatment. Nature is the test of dialectics, and it must be said for modern natural
science that it has furnished extremely rich and daily increasing materials for this test,
and has thus proved that in the last analysis Nature&#146;s process is dialectical and not
metaphysical. </p>

<p>&quot;But the scientists who have learnt to think dialectically are still few and far
between, and hence the conflict between the discoveries made and the old traditional mode
of thought is the explanation of the boundless confusion which now reigns in theoretical
natural science and reduces both teachers and students, writers and readers to
despair.&quot; (22) </p>

<p>Over one hundred years ago, old Engels accurately describes the state of the physical
sciences today. This is acknowledged by Ilya Prigogine (Nobel-prize winner for chemistry
1977) and Isabelle Stengers in their book Order Out of Chaos, Man&#146;s New Dialogue with
Nature, where they writes the following: </p>

<p>&quot;To a certain extent, there is an analogy between this conflict (between Newtonian
physics and the new scientific ideas) and the one that gave rise to dialectical
materialism&#133;The idea of a history of nature as an integral part of materialism was
asserted by Marx and, in greater detail, by Engels. Contemporary developments in physics,
the discovery of the constructive role played by irreversibility, have thus raised within
the natural sciences a question that has long been asked by materialists. For them,
understanding nature meant understanding it as being capable of producing man and his
societies. </p>

<p>&quot;Moreover, at the time Engels wrote his Dialectics of Nature, the physical
sciences seemed to have rejected the mechanistic world view and drawn closer to the idea
of an historical development of nature. Engels mentions three fundamental discoveries:
energy and the laws governing its qualitative transformations, the cell as the basic
constituent of life, and Darwin&#146;s discovery of the evolution of species. In view of
these great discoveries, Engels came to the conclusion that the mechanistic world view was
dead.&quot; (23) </p>

<p>Despite all the wonderful advances of science and technology, there is a deep-seated
feeling of malaise. An increasing number of scientists are beginning to rebel against the
prevailing orthodoxies and seek new solutions to the problems facing them. Sooner or
later, this is bound to result in a new revolution in science, similar to the one effected
by Einstein and Planck nearly a century ago. Significantly, Einstein himself was far from
being a member of the scientific establishment. </p>

<p>&quot;The mainstream for most of the twentieth century,&quot; Gleick remarks, &quot;has
been particle physics, exploring the building blocks of matter at higher and higher
energies, smaller and smaller scale, shorter and shorter times. Out of particle physics
have come theories about the fundamental forces of nature and about the origin of the
universe. Yet some young physicists have grown dissatisfied with the direction of the most
prestigious of sciences. Progress has begun to seem slow, the naming of new particles
futile, the body of theory cluttered. With the coming of chaos, younger scientists
believed they were seeing the beginnings of a course change for all of physics. The field
had been dominated long enough, they felt, by the glittering abstractions of high-energy
particles and quantum mechanics.&quot; </p>

<p><strong><a name="Chaos and Dialectics">Chaos and Dialectics</a> </strong></p>

<p>It is as yet too early to form a definitive view of chaos theory. However, what is
clear is that these scientists are groping in the direction of a dialectical view of
nature. For example, the dialectical law of the transformation of quantity into quality
(and vice versa) plays a prominent sole in chaos theory: </p>

<p>&quot;He (Von Neumann) recognised that a complicated dynamical system could have points
of instability&#151;critical points where a small push can have large consequences, as
with a ball balanced at the top of a hill.&quot; </p>

<p>And again: </p>

<p>&quot;In science as in life, it is well known that a chain of events can have a point
of crisis that could magnify small changes. But chaos meant that such points were
everywhere. They were pervasive.&quot; (24) </p>

<p>These and many other passages reveal a striking resemblance between certain aspects of
chaos theory and dialectics. Yet the most incredible thing is that most of the pioneers of
&quot;chaos&quot; seem to have not the slightest knowledge not only of the writings of
Marx and Engels, but even of Hegel! In one sense, this provides even more striking
confirmation of the correctness of dialectical materialism. But in another, it is a
frustrating thought that the absence of an adequate philosophical framework and
methodology has been denied to science needlessly and for such a long time. </p>

<p>For 300 years, physics was based on linear systems. The name linear refers to the fact
that if you plot such an equation on a graph, it emerges as a straight line. Indeed, much
of nature appears to work precisely in this way. This is why classical mechanics is able
to describe it adequately. However, much of nature is not linear, and cannot be understood
through linear systems. The brain certainly does not function in a linear manner, nor does
the economy, with its chaotic cycle of booms and slumps. A non-linear equation is not
expressed in a straight line, but takes into account the irregular, contradictory and
frequently chaotic nature of reality. </p>

<p>&quot;All this makes me feel very unhappy about cosmologists who tell us that they&#146;ve
got the origins of the Universe pretty well wrapped up, except for the first millisecond
or so of the Big Bang. And with politicians who assure us that not only is a solid dose of
monetarism going to be good for us, but they&#146;re so certain about it that a few
million unemployed must be just a minor hiccup. The mathematical ecologist Robert May
voiced similar sentiments in 1976. &#145;Not only in research, but in the everyday world
of politics and economics, we would all be better off if more people realised that simple
systems do not necessarily possess simple dynamical properties.&#146;&quot; (25) </p>

<p>The problems of modern science could be overcome far more easily by adopting a
conscious (as opposed to an unconscious, haphazard, empirical) dialectical method. It is
clear that the general philosophical implications of chaos theory are disputed by its
scientists. Gleick quotes Ford, &quot;a self-proclaimed evangelist of chaos&quot; as
saying that chaos means &quot;systems liberated to randomly explore their every dynamic
possibility&#133;&quot; Others refer to apparently random systems. Perhaps the best
definition comes from Jensen, a theoretical physicist at Yale, who defines
&quot;chaos&quot; as &quot;the irregular, unpredictable behaviour of deterministic,
non-linear dynamical systems.&quot; </p>

<p>Rather than elevate randomness to a principle of nature, as Ford seems to do, the new
science does the opposite: it shows irrefutably that processes that were considered to be
random (and may still be so considered, for everyday purposes) are nevertheless driven by
an underlying determinism&#151;not the crude mechanical determinism of the 18th century
but dialectical determinism. </p>

<p>Some of the claims being made for the new science are very grand, and with the
refinement and development of methods and techniques, may well prove true. Some of its
exponents go so far as to say that the 20th century will be known for three things:
relativity, quantum mechanics and chaos. Albert Einstein, although one of the founders of
quantum theory, was never reconciled to the idea of a non-deterministic universe. In a
letter to the physicist Neils Bohr, he insisted that &quot;God does not play dice.&quot;
Chaos theory has not only shown Einstein to be correct on this point, but even in its
infancy, it is a brilliant confirmation of the fundamental world view put forward by Marx
and Engels over a hundred years ago. </p>

<p>It is really astonishing that so many of the advocates of chaos theory, who are
attempting to break with the stultifying &quot;linear&quot; methodology and work out a new
&quot;non-linear&quot; mathematics, which is more in consonance with the turbulent reality
of ever-changing nature, appear to be completely unaware of the only genuine revolution in
logic in two millennia&#151;the dialectical logic elaborated by Hegel, and subsequently
perfected on a scientific and materialist basis by Marx and Engels. How many errors, blind
alleys and crises in science could have been avoided if scientists had been equipped with
a methodology which genuinely reflects the dynamic reality of nature, instead of
conflicting with it at every turn! </p>
