		<li>Artificial Consciousness -<span class="paratext">The
idea that people may create devices that are conscious is known as
artificial consciousness (AC). This is an ancient idea, perhaps dating
back to the ancient Greek promethean myth in which conscious people
were supposedly manufactured from clay, pottery being an advanced
technology in those days.</span></li>
		<li>Artificial Chemistry -<span class="paratext">An
artificial chemistry is a computer model used to simulate various types
of systems. The name comes from the fact that an artificial chemistry
is in some ways similar to a chemical reaction. Artificial chemistry
originated in artificial life but has shown to be a versatile method
with applications in many fields such as chemistry, economics,
sociology and linguistics.</span></li>
		<li>Digital Organisms -<span class="paratext">A
digital organism is a self-replicating computer program that mutates
and evolves. Digital organisms are used as a tool to study the dynamics
of Darwinian evolution, and to test or verify specific hypotheses or
mathematical models of evolution.</span></li>
		<li>Evolutionary Art -<span class="paratext">Evolutionary
Art exploits the process of evolution to create an artwork which
continually changes according to an evolutionary algorithm.
In common with natural selection and animal husbandry, the members of a
population undergoing artificial evolution modify their form or
behaviour over many reproductive generations in response to a selective
regime.
</span></li>
		<li>Clanking Replicator -<span class="paratext">A
clanking replicator is an artificial self-replicating system that
relies on conventional large-scale technology and automation. The term
evolved to distinguish such systems from the microscopic "assemblers"
that nanotechnology may make possible.</span></li>
		<li>Carbon Chauvinism -<span class="paratext">Carbon
chauvinism is the viewpoint in xenobiology that carbon is necessarily
the basis of all life on other planets, as carbon's chemical and
thermodynamic properties render it far superior to all other elements.
There are, however, several other possible bases for life with varying
degrees of plausibility.</span></li>
		<li>Robotics -<span class="paratext">In
practical usage, a robot is a mechanical device which performs
automated tasks, either according to direct human supervision, a
pre-defined program or, a set of general guidelines, using artificial
intelligence techniques. These tasks either replace or enhance human
work, such as in manufacturing, construction or manipulation of heavy
or hazardous materials.</span></li>
