<p><b>The procedure for constructing the regional maps</b>
<p>The maps presented here are based on inter-disciplinary interpretation
of evidence from plant fossils, together with zoological evidence, soil
and sedimentological analyses which also have some bearing on vegetation
cover. The approach has been to review current literature and liase with
experts from each region (acknowledged within the text). Given the scope
of the task, regional review sources and published maps have been an important
source of information, with less emphasis placed on consulting every published
paper on each region (of which there are many thousands). In many areas,
the evidence is sparsely distributed and the map reconstructions presented
here should only be regarded as tentative. Summaries of the evidence from
each region are presented, in order to give some impression of the quality
of data currently available, and the present disagreements within the literature.
It is to be expected that as further evidence accumulates over the coming
years, significant revisions to these maps will become necessary.

<p><b>Summary maps of forest and desert cover</b>
<p>The four maps below provide a rough guideline to the general changes
in vegetation cover that have occurred since the Last Glacial Maximum.
They are roughly drawn and not intended as a reference source (the more
detailed regional maps on these web pages will provide you with a much
more accurate guide to the likely palaeovegetation cover). They are merely
a brief introduction to show how the world changed. It is evident that
for 18,000 14C years ago the area of the most extreme deserts was much
greater than in either the present day world or the other two Holocene
time slices. For the early and mid-Holocene, in contrast, extreme desert
almost disappeared due to much moister climates.
<p>During the arid LGM and the several thousand years that followed it,
forest cover was also greatly reduced due to a mixture of cold and aridity.
Closed forests were almost non-existent in Europe and Siberia, and tropical
forest seems to have been confined by aridity to what are presently the
highest rainfall areas. The early-to-mid Holocene (8,000 &amp; 5,000 BP)
had greater forest cover due to higher rainfall in many parts of the world,
and slightly warmer temperatures in the high latitudes and at high altitudes.
<p>This is not the only set of maps that have been put together for the
last 20,000 years. This linked page <a href="mapping.html">discusses the
differences between various published palaeovegetation maps</a>

<p><a href="lastgla.gif">Last Glacial Maximum vegetation</a>
<p><b>Summary map of vegetation cover at 18,000 14C years BP</b>. This
map illustrates the aridity of full-glacial conditions suggested on the
basis of palaeoevidence from around the world; there was much less closed
forest and more desert than at present. In fact, current evidence from
various parts of the world suggests that the greatest overall aridity was
reached slightly after 18,000 14C y.a., and closer to 16,000-14,000 BP.
In this sense, the map may be more appropriate as a representation of conditions
slightly after the LGM. Nevertheless, the whole period from about 21,000-
14,000 14C y.a. seems to have experienced much colder and more arid conditions
than at present.

Holocene vegetation</a>
<p><b>Summary map of vegetation cover at 8,000 14C years BP</b>. By 8,000
14C y.a., the Earth was under a full interglacial climate, with conditions
warmer and moister than present in many parts of the world. Tropical forest
in Africa (and probably also Asia) was expanded in area, and the areas
of desert in Africa and Asia were much reduced.

<p><b>Summary map of 'present potential' vegetation cover</b>. This map
is for purposes of comparison, showing the areas of forest and other desert
that would be present in the present-day world if humans had not altered
them by agriculture and forestry. Although it represents a 'potential'
state, it is nevertheless much as the world would actually have looked
about 4,000-3,000 14C y.a., before agriculture became important in modifying
vegetation cover in many regions.
