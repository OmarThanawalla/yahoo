		<p class = "p1"> <span> The Stanford Alchemy Society, previously known as the Stanford Chemistry Club, is a student-run group sponsored by the Chemistry Dept. </span> </p>
		<p class = "p2"> <span> We put on chemistry shows for local elementary, junior high, and high schools in the Bay Area as well as other youth organizations such as the Boys and Girls Club and YMCA. Within the Stanford community, we help to encourage students to meet and to get involved with Stanford professors in the Chemistry department. We hold research workshops, faculty lunches, and even put on shows during events such as Community Day. </span></p>
