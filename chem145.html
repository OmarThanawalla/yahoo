</CENTER>
<P><STRONG>What is tularemia?</STRONG></P>
<P>Tularemia, or rabbit fever, is a bacterial disease associated with both
animals and humans. Although many wild and domestic animals can be infected,
the rabbit is most often involved in disease outbreaks. Tularemia is relatively
rare in Illinois; five or fewer cases are reported each year.</P>
<P><STRONG>Who gets tularemia?</STRONG></P>
<P>The disease occurs throughout the United States in all months of the year.
The incidence, however, is higher for adults in early winter during rabbit
hunting season and for children during the summer when ticks and deer flies are
abundant.</P>
<P><STRONG>How is tularemia spread?</STRONG></P>
<P>Many routes of human exposure to the tularemia bacteria are known to exist.
The common routes include inoculation of the skin or mucous membranes with
blood or tissue while handling infected animals, the bite of an infected tick,
contact with fluids from infected deer flies or ticks, or handling or eating
insufficiently cooked rabbit meat. Less common means of spread are drinking
contaminated water, inhaling dust from contaminated soil or handling
contaminated pelts or paws of animals. Tularemia is not spread from person to
person.</P>
<P><STRONG>What are the symptoms of tularemia?</STRONG></P>
<P>Symptoms vary, depending on the route of introduction. In those cases where
a person becomes infected from handling an animal carcass, symptoms can include
a slow-growing ulcer at the site where the bacteria entered the skin (usually
on the hand) and swollen lymph nodes. If the bacteria is inhaled, a
pneumonia-like illness can follow. Those who ingest the bacteria may report a
sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting.</P>
<P><STRONG>How soon do symptoms appear?</STRONG></P>
<P>Symptoms can appear between one and 14 days after exposure, but usually do
so after three to five days.</P>
<P><STRONG>What is the treatment for tularemia?</STRONG></P>
<P>The drug of choice for treating tularemia is streptomycin or gentamicin,
although other antibiotics also are effective.</P>
<P><STRONG>Does past infection with tularemia make a person immune?</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>Long-term immunity usually follows recovery from tularemia. However,
reinfection has been reported.</P>
<P><STRONG>What can be done to prevent the spread of tularemia?</STRONG></P>
<P>Several precautions can protect individuals from tularemia.</P>
<UL>
<LI> Avoid drinking, bathing, swimming or working in untreated water where
infection may be common among wild animals. </LI>
<LI> Use impervious gloves when skinning or handling animals, especially
rabbits. </LI>
<LI> Cook the meat of wild rabbits and rodents thoroughly.</LI>
<LI>Avoid being bitten by deer flies and ticks. The following suggestions may
help: <OL>
<LI>Check your clothing often for ticks climbing toward open skin. Wear white
or light-colored long-sleeved shirts and long pants so the tiny ticks are
easier to see. Tuck long pants into your socks and boots. Wear a head covering
or hat for added protection. </LI>
<LI>For those who may not tolerate wearing all of these clothes in hot, muggy
weather, apply insect repellent containing DEET (30 percent or less) to exposed
skin (except the face). Be sure to wash treated skin after coming indoors. If
you do cover up, use repellents containing permethrin to treat clothes
(especially pants, socks and shoes) while in locations where ticks may be
common. Follow label directions; do not misuse or overuse repellents. Always
supervise children in the use of repellents. </LI>
<LI>Walk in the center of trails so weeds do not brush against you. </LI>
<LI>Check yourself, children and other family members every two to three hours
for ticks. Most ticks seldom attach quickly and rarely transmit tickborne
disease until they have been attached for four or more hours. </LI>
<LI>If you let your pets outdoors, check them often for ticks. Infected ticks
also can transmit some tickborne diseases to them. (Check with your
veterinarian about preventive measures against tickborne diseases.) You are at
risk from ticks that &quot;hitch a ride&quot; on your pets but fall off in your
home before they feed. </LI>
<LI> Make sure the property around your home is unattractive to ticks. Keep
your grass mowed and keep weeds cut. </LI>
</OL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>How should an attached tick be removed?</STRONG></P>
<P>Remove any tick promptly. Do not try to burn the tick with a match or cover
it with petroleum jelly or nail polish. Do not use bare hands. The best way to
remove a tick is to grasp it with fine-point tweezers as close to the skin as
possible and gently, but firmly, pull it straight out. Do not twist or jerk the
tick. If tweezers are not available, grasp the tick with a piece of cloth or
whatever can be used as a barrier between your fingers and the tick. You may
want to put the tick in a jar of rubbing alcohol labeled with the date and
location of the bite in case you seek medical attention and your physician
wishes to have the tick identified.</P>
<P>The mouthparts of a tick are shaped like tiny barbs and may remain embedded
and lead to infection at the bite site if not removed properly. Be sure to wash
the bite area and your hands thoroughly with soap and water, and apply an
antiseptic to the bite site.</P>
<P><STRONG>Why is there concern about tularemia as a bioweapon?</STRONG></P>
<P>Tularemia, in aerosol form, is considered a possible bioterrorist agent.
Persons who inhale an infectious aerosol would likely experience severe
respiratory illness. Any suspected cases of tularemia inhalation should be
immediately reported to local and state health departments.</P>
