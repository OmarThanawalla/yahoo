Welcome to the Bioethics Discussion Pages</h3></center>

<h4>
These pages are where the questions and responses to bioethical issues
are located. EVERYONE is invited to write to me about what YOU think about
these issues. Bioethical questions may have significance for all of society
and therefore the general public as well as ethicists should get involved
and express what they think. Participants may write about any of the topics
or invite discussion with a new topic. I post these responses here and
update the responses frequently. The policy is that I always include the
participant's e-mail address.
There is also a polling section ("What is Your Opinion?") to this page
where I occasionally present an ethical issue for the visitors to vote upon anonymously so that
we might see what is the trend of opinion. <!---If you participate you should
know that your response will be identified to me with your name and e-mail
address included. I will not disclose your individual response to anyone.--->
I will present a <!---an anonymous---> summary of results after a couple months.<P>
<P><B>
<!---Beginning in November 2001 a <a href="#BJC">BIOETHICS JOURNAL CLUB </a>was started for discussion by the club members of selected journal articles related to bioethics. <A Href= "mailto:DoktorMo@aol.com"> Let me know if you would like to join the club and participate with the other members in reviewing these articles.</a>---><P>
<h3> <B>NEWS</B></h3><P><P>
I want to announce that at the present our Bioethics Discussion Journal Club

  is  INACTIVE.  My intention is to try to establish an active club again.

      Finally, I want to introduce our visitors to my Bioethics Discussion Blog.  The link

 button to go to that site is located at the bottom of this page. <P> The blog is much different than this website

.The goals of both are to encourage the thoughtful discussion of bioethical issues.  This

 website provides a number of issues about which the visitors can express their

 viewpoints.  I just moderate here.  On my blog, I am the one who sets out views and

 offers opportunity for the visitor to comment on them.  I have started out with one
 
bioethical issue and will gradually expand it to sub-issues or other issues as they appear

 in the news or are of general interest.  I will also try to include links to various pertinent

 resources, which can broaden the discussion.  I hope you will give my blog a try and let

 me know what you think.  ..Maurice.

<CENTER><H3><b> WHY DID YOU COME TO THIS PLACE?</H3></b></CENTER>
This is a very important question to me in order to understand the needs of my visitors.  It seems very 
unlikely that a visitor arrived at my web site just through random browsing through the millions of web sites 
on the Internet.  There must have been some motivation or need to find this place and I would like to know 
why. <A Href= "mailto:DoktorMo@aol.com?subject=Why I Came Here"> Please write and tell me.</A>  And Welcome!
<CENTER> <H3> <B> GOT A BIOETHICS QUESTION WHICH NEEDS A QUICK ANSWER? </H3></B></CENTER>
I have found that many those who answered my question above are students who are working on a bioethics paper for school.  When they write me, I try to give some suggestions.  However, it may take a day or two before I can e-mail them back my comments.  For those visitors, including non-students, who would like to be able to communicate directly with a "live" ethics resource person and get the information in real time, the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics has a Bioethics HelpLine 
<a href="http://www.ajobonline.com/hsbioethics/">http://www.ajobonline.com/hsbioethics/</a>
which is available and free. (Hours: Sun thru Thursday 7 pm to 11pm EST). The chat system is directed primarily for highschool students but I was informed that all other individuals who have a need for bioethics information will be serviced.  The system is popular and you may have to wait to contact a resource person.  Have your question clearly thought out so you can easily communicate what you want to know.  Let me know how this HelpLine has worked out for you. <HR><HR><HR><CENTER>
ANOTHER BIOETHICS RESOURCE SITE FOR REVIEW AND DISCUSSIONS OF BIOETHICAL THEMES</CENTER>
<P>
I would like to encourage my visitors to go to the American Medical Association's <a href="http://www.virtualmentor.org">Virtual Mentor (http://www.virtualmentor.org)</a>.  It is a place where everyone including medical students can go to read presentations and commentary of issues and standards of practice related to monthly bioethical themes.

<h2> THE ROLE OF THE BIOETHICIST </h2>
Sara Inteller wrote me regarding her concerns about bioethics and bioethicists.  She reflects some of the same concerns of other visitors who have written to me.  I thought I would present her e-mail here and then, following, present my viewpoint. </B>

From: saragirl666@hotmail.com
To: DoktorMo@aol.com
<P>
Dear Doctor, in viewing your web-site I couldn't decide on one topic specifically to write to you about, hence the title of this e-mail. I recently read a book about euthanasia, assisted suicide, Futile Care Theory, and various other aspects of bioethics. I found many aspects of this "Profession" and its theories and teachings to be profoundly disturbing. To begin with, one of the fundamental beliefs is the right to personal autonomy, yet when it comes down to a decision that involves a patient, or the patients family, voting in favor of prolonged life treatment, the right to accept, rather then reject treatment, can be stripped of them if the physician deems the care to be "unethical" or "futile." How exactly can someone argue that a patients right to reject treatment is unquestionable and should never be violated, and at the same time be willing to also deny someone of the right to remain living if that is their desire? In the matter of ethics, one can surely argue that a physician would have difficulties discontinuing treatment of someone they feel may eventually recover, yet they are required to do so if that is the patients desire. Why then are physicians allowed to use their "ethics" to refuse end of life care to someone who has requested it? In either situation it basically comes down to the patients right to autonomy, yet the rules in one instance don't apply to the other in all cases. Why does bioethics firmly uphold someone�s decision to die, yet question someone�s right to live? As far as care being futile, the arguments for individual cases could go on for years. But I believe it is safe to say that in more instances then not, a doctor cannot "guarantee" that someone is going to die in spite of care, so therefore an issue of futility, in a true and complete meaning, can rarely be established
  <P>   Something quite possibly as disturbing is the belief that an infant is a "non-person�, and therefore doesn't have a right to live; leaving them to be disposed of or experimented on with supposedly no moral ramifications. At what point do you think someone becomes a "person," doctor? Is it their ability to feel pain, their cognitive abilities, their age, or their desire to live? To dispose of someone because they don't yet have an ability to want to be alive is ludicrous. If we take that view in an absolute sense then NO one has ever had a right to live, and therefore if every human had been destroyed upon birth then there would be nothing wrong with that, because after all we aren't really people at that early stage. </td> <td VALIGN=TOP>
Supposedly most infants that are allowed to die have a debilitating disease, yet how can someone label their life useless or burdensome when nearly all of these diseases can be treated, and in time some even cured? Better still, how can one argue that letting an infant starve to death or dehydrate is much more humane then giving them the option of living with a disease or disability? Dying in either of these ways would obviously be painful, so where is the humanity? Whose welfare is being benefited in these situations? Since it is apparent that a bioethicist wouldn't bat an eyelash at starving a "nonperson" and causing them a painful death, why should the public be lead to believe that this field of medicine is aimed at humanitary pursuits? In all reality isn't bioethics really a justified way of labeling people as useless, if it is the consensus of some "educated" people held in high esteem? If it isn't then why is the public so vastly uneducated about this field? No one that I know has ever even heard of this, let alone understands what its teachings entail. Could it be that if the majority of the general public knew in detail what bioethics is, that they would be outraged by its lack of respect for life or human worth, or worse yet even be educated enough to know what kind of medical decisions they want to make for themselves, thereby inhibiting an ethicists ability to taint their judgment on end of life care when it is too late for them to make a truly well-thought out choice.
  <P>   I am an atheist, and I am not afraid of death. I do not however agree that life has the small amount of sanctity that bioethics affords it. In any case, it should be up to a person on how to execute their decisions as regards end of life care, and other personal medical matters. I doubt seriously that most people realize that those rights can be stripped of them if someone else deems their life "futile," and if you disagree with me then maybe you can explain why assisted suicides of people in horrible pain and other supposedly humane aspects of bioethics are featured in the media, while you'll rarely hear a documentary speaking of the virtues of starving infants or denying people medical treatment they need in order to live.I would appreciate a response to my inquiries.
Sincerely,  Sara Inteller</td>

<H3> MY OWN VIEW... </H3>
The concerns and opinion voiced by Sara about bioethics and bioethicists is one that many other visitors have also written to me about.  Many have read Dean Koontz's novel "One Door Away from Heaven" or read about Peter Singer.  I try to write them back with my understanding and opinion about bioethics and about those who work within this applied discipline of philosophy. 
      I believe that if any bioethical consensus can be reached on an issue, it 
is <I>not</I> created by bioethicists, philosophers, physicians, lawyers or other 
elite as my visitors suggest.  It is rendered by Society of which all the  
visitors to my website are a part.  I would encourage the visitors to express their own 
opinions on my website but also in other public ways so that they may contribute to the general pool of opinion which can be accessed by governments, the courts and the other institutions which set guidelines for behavior or laws.  I believe that 
bioethicists do have a role to play but only to present to the public 
alternate ways of looking at ethical issues, educating the public regarding 
bioethical history and the law and helping to mediate ethical conflicts.  I 
emphasize the role of the bioethicist is <I>not</I> to issue a professional 
bioethical dictum to society.  Bioethicists may, as any member of society, 
express their own personal views but the public should take them simply as 
personal views and nothing further.  
     Our visitors should be encouraged to know that even amongst ethicists there is just as much confusion and debate about issues and definition or limits of autonomy and futility or when "personhood" begins as there is amongst our visitors. Don't just sit back and grumble to yourself but speak out.
I suspect there are many ethicists who are waiting to hear from you!</B>

<h2> SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 </h2>
<table CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=10 WIDTH="99%" >

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>What happened in the United States on September 11 2001 was so terrible and so grossly unethical and representing such a threat to peoples of our country and of the world that it would seem that the societal significance all of the bioethical discussions on this website just pales by comparison. One can say, "Why worry any more about whether cloning, euthanasia or genetic testing is ethical or whether a patient has received informed consent when such an unbelievable magnitude of maleficence has just occurred?" But is such comparison valid? All of society is made up of individuals and how individuals interact with each other has discrete moral value concerns that cannot be trumped or ignored by the concerns for the events such as what happened on September 11th or the Nazi holocaust, for example. In fact, it is the ignoring of the individual and that person's needs, goals and basic human rights, which has contributed to such events.&nbsp;</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP> <I>MORE ON SEPTMBER ELEVENTH AS VIEWED FROM MARCH 2002 <P>The viewpoint of my editorial reminder written in September 2001 as a response to the terror of September 11th 2001 might need to be modified with another reality as suggested in an article titled "Bioethics after the Terror" by Jonathan D. Moreno in the American Journal of Bioethics, vol. 2 no. 1 (Winter 2002).  The question raised is whether the social consensus about individual autonomy of medical research subjects or patients might be changed because of the event of September 11th and subsequent further concern about terrorists attacks on the US homeland and a prolonged "War on Terrorism." Will there be more emphasis on the need for the good of the community and society rather than for  the autonomous based good of the individual?

<P>

I visited your page recently for the first time in several months, and read
with interest your piece on the September 11 tragedy.  I'm thankful you
concluded that our concern for other issues should not diminish because of
this, but I find myself angry that the question should need to be asked in
the first place, that people (not picking on you in particular!) continue to
labour under the delusion that a large-scale, in-your-face tragedy somehow
renders all other ethical issues irrelevant.  It may perhaps help us get
things in perspective and weed out some of the genuine trivialities that
we've been stewing over, but it does not make all issues trivial.  
<P>
In the months after September 11 I had a number of people ask me how I could
care about this or that when so many people had died.  Those questions
disturbed me, and a few weeks ago I read something by one of my least
favorite newspaper editors on a different topic which helped me understand
why.  The editor was discussing the cruel live sheep export trade, and
sanctimoniously told readers that their concern for the sheep would soon
evaporate if they pictured children in this situation instead.  Well no,
dammit, it wouldn't.  Two wrongs do not make a right.  Some people may judge
one wrong as being greater than another, but the lesser one does not then
evaporate.
Similarly, some tragedies are silent, chronic, largely hidden from the
public eye, and eminently ignorable by well-off Westerners, but for all that
they are no less tragic than September 11.  To name just a few ... consider
that thousands of third world children die EVERY DAY from malnutrition and
easily treatable illnesses.  That millions of people live in grinding
poverty on the bare edge of existence with no chance to rise above their
circumstances.  That many more are killed, repressed and displaced by wars
which have nothing to do with them. </td>
<td VALIGN=TOP>
That slavery and torture still happen in
many parts of the world. That thousands upon thousands of the so called
"food animals" killed every year in our slaughterhouses are skinned and
butchered alive and fully conscious because of lack of control and
supervision on the production line.  That thousands of healthy animals are
"euthanised" annually for no greater crime than being unwanted by the humans
who have supposedly taken on responsibility for their care.
<P>
I would consider each one of these things to be a tragedy of "an
unbelievable magnitude of maleficence", easily on a par with September 11.
Perhaps even more so because of the very fact that, when they are
acknowledged at all, it's usually with a shrug and an attitude of "I won't
think about that because then I might feel guilty and have to change my
comfortable life".  These things are happening each and every day, causing a
total of death and suffering far greater than September 11, but they don't
make the headlines.  Enough people who cared and who opened their hearts in
the same way they did to the September 11 victims could make an unbelievable
difference to many of these situations.  I don't mean to make light of
September 11 or the victims' suffering, but I freely admit it makes me angry
that events like this are considered the epitome of tragedy against which
all else is supposed to pale into insignificance.  The real tragedy to me is
the number of horrors in this world about which people don't care.

TOPIC 6: POLL RESULTS</h3></center>
<P>
<P>
<center> (Data collected 3/2/2000 through 12/21/2000)</center><P>
Regarding what society considers the duties of a physician, there are some who wonder
whether physicians are responsible to not only prevent and treat disease but also to make patients look and 
feel more attractive and powerful.
<h3>The question was: </H3>
<P><B>Do you think it is right for the role of a physician to include writing prescriptions or carrying out 
procedures in order to improve the patient's appearance and performance in the absence of disease or 
deformities from birth or injury or illness?</B><center>
<h3><B>THE RESULTS: 95 responses</center></H3>
<center>NO- 58%<P>
YES- 42%</center><P></B>
   It appears there is, in this unscientific poll, a support by a number of visitors that physicians should not 
have a role which includes treating appearance or performance in the absence of illness or injury.  However, 
to read the comments of visitors who wrote on this subject, click here:

TOPIC 5: POLL RESULTS</h3></center>
<P>
<P>
<center>(Data collected 4/14/97 through 6/25/97)</center>
There are three criteria for death which are
being debated. 1) Permanent cessation of heartbeat and respiration 2) Whole
Brain Death-Permanent and total cessation of all brain function which includes
absence of spontaneous breathing and expected cessation of heartbeat soon.
3) Permanent and total absence of consciousness despite ability to continue
to breathe or maintain heartbeat. It is important that society has input
into which definition should be the appropriate one in this era of "life
support" and "organ retrieval" for transplant.
<h3>
The question was:</h3>

<p><b>What should be the criterion for death?</b>
<center>
<h3>
THE RESULTS: 46 responses:</h3></center>

<center><B>Cessation of Heart Beat and Respiration 7
<p>Whole Brain Death 22
<p>Permanent Absence of Consciousness 15
<p>Some Other Criterion 2</center></B><P>
It appears that our visitors selected whole brain death over the classic
cessation of heart beat and respiration by 3:1. Interestingly, a fairly
close second most popular criterion was the controversial permanent unconsciousness.
One might conclude that the visitors who voted find the classic criterion
inadequate for todays medical necessities. Any comments?

<center>(Data collected 1/9/97 through 4/8/97)</center>

<h3>
Here are the polling questions:</h3>
<b>How important, do you think, is the Advance Directive toward proper
medical care?</b>
<center>
<h3>
THE RESULTS: 37 responses:</h3></center><B>

<center>&nbsp;Not Important-0
<p>Somewhat Important-1
<p>&nbsp;Important-9
<p>&nbsp;Very Important-27</center></B>

<center>
<h3>
<b>Have you yourself prepared an Advance Directive?</b></h3></center>

<B><center>&nbsp;THE RESULTS: 38 responses:Yes-16 No-22</center></B>

<p>Obviously virtually all responders to the poll found that advance directives
were important or very important. Interestingly, of the 27 who found them
"very" important 13 had their own directive. Of the 9 who found them important
only 2 had their own directive. I suspect the population who represent
visitors to this bioethics site may have a greater appreciation of advance
directives than the general population. I would be interested in the comments
of others about this poll.

<h3>
THE QUESTION WAS "In order to obtain enough organs to be transplanted into
needy patients, should laws be passed which allow organs to be obtained
from persons who have died without the prior permission of the patient
or any permission of the family?"</h3></center>

<center>
<h3>
THE RESULTS: 35 responses- NO 71% YES 29%</h3></center>
The consensus seems clear that a deceased's organ does not become public
property regardless of the need.

TOPIC 1 POLL RESULTS</h3></center>

<center>
<h3>
THE QUESTION WAS "Do you agree with the decision of the 9th Circuit Court
that physician assisted suicide for competent terminally ill adults should
be permitted?"</h3></center>

<center>
<h3>
THE RESULTS: 36 responses- YES 67% NO 33%</h3></center>
It is of interest that 9 of the responses were from visitors outside of
the USA of which 56% were YES and 44% NO. This would leave the 27 responses
from USA visitors yielding 70% YES and 30% NO. Unfortunately, there were
fewer responses during the 3 month period (May-August 1996) this poll was
running than I had hoped for, however I think my poll is in line with other
polls which confirm a favorable public attitude toward physician assisted
suicide.
