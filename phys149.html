To Focus on Dry, Preloaded CF/LANR&nbsp;Platform</strong></span></span>&nbsp;</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-size: 14px">On July 1, 2013, Nanortech, Inc. was launched to solely focus on advancing and producing the NANOR&reg;-type LANR quantum electronic component, a revolutionary, extraordinary energy production platform.&nbsp; Nanortech, Inc. is at the cutting edge of advanced energy production components using preloaded nanostructured materials as base platforms for a new spectrum of efficient heaters, cleaner water, cheaper electricity, and specialized products for propulsion and medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nanortech, Inc. is a spin-off of JET Energy, Inc., which has developed and acquired successful aqueous and nanomaterial LANR IP and technology since 1989, and has openly&nbsp;demonstrated the &quot;over unity&quot; NANOR&reg;-type LANR component at MIT in 2012 over several months, during its second open demonstration of LANR technology.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-size: 14px">&nbsp;Everyone wants a better source of energy which is clean, non-radioactive, and plentiful to power homes and cars. If not for nanotechnology and the Nanor&reg;-type LANR, the outlook would indeed appear darker because people also want less dependence on oil, even as alternatives like wind and solar, remain unreliable and relatively low efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nanortech, Inc. components have an incredible advantage over other products because of their energy gain and the fact that they are among&nbsp; the most efficient cleanest energy production systems that exists. &nbsp;&nbsp;The present NANOR&reg;-type LANR devices and systems are solid-state, dry, and contain palladium nanoparticles embedded in zirconium oxide insulation, preloaded with deuterium, and fabricated to greatly enhance repeatability and deliver significant excess energy gain.&nbsp; The NANOR&reg;-type LANR device demonstrated at MIT ran at the MIT Energy Production and Energy Conversion lab between late January- May, 2012 and generated excess energy, with 7 to 20+ times input instantaneous electrical power (energy gain).&nbsp;&nbsp; And the carbon footprint is zero.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The reason we need cold fusion now, Swartz explained, is the fact that we&nbsp;simply do not have a reproducible<strong>, highly efficient,</strong> clean source of energy production.&nbsp;&nbsp;.... Swartz detailed the impact of what further use of this energy source, and its secondary pollution, would be on our quality of life, including generating serious health and financial problems. He focused on recent news, including the tragic pollution situation in Utah which is another glaring indictment of that energy production system. For every gigawatt per day a city requires the &ldquo;burning of 9,000 tons of coal. . .Each one of those makes (as pollution) yet another 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), 600 tons of sulfur dioxide (SO2), 80 tons of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and tons of other pollutants. These obviously are things we could avoid with a cold fusion system,&rdquo; Swartz said. He then demonstrated how all those pollution problems go away with cold fusion. With LANR systems, the equivalent fuel is&nbsp;only about 4 pounds of heavy water to generate a small amount of helium per day<span style="font-size: 14px"><span lang=""><span class="ofnote"><span lang="EN"><font face="Calibri"><font face="Calibri"><span lang="">.&quot; </span></font></font></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span style="font-size: 14px">June 21 2013 - </span><span style="font-size: 14px"><font size="+0">&quot;Why is mercury a liquid at room temperature? .... An international team led by Peter Schwerdtfeger of Massey University Auckland in New Zealand used quantum mechanics to make calculations of the heat capacity of the metal either including or excluding relativistic effects. They showed that if they ignored relativity when making their calculations, the predicted melting point of mercury was 82&deg;C. But if they included relativistic effects their answer closely matched the experimental value of -39&deg;C. ... as you go down the periodic table these 1s electrons get faster and faster, and therefore heavier, causing the radius of the atom to shrink. This stabilises some orbitals, which also have a relativistic nature of their own, while destabilising others. This interplay means that for heavy elements like mercury and gold, the outer electrons are stabilised. In mercury&rsquo;s case, instead of forming bonds between neighbouring mercury atoms, the electrons stay associated with their own nuclei, and weaker interatomic forces such as van der Waals bonds hold the atoms together. ... In the 1960s, Pekka Pyykk&ouml;, now at University of Helsinki, Finland, discovered that gold&rsquo;s colour was the result of relativistic effects. He showed that the lower energy levels of the 6s orbital of gold means that the energy required to excite an electron from the 5d band lies in the visible rather than UV range of light. This means that gold absorbs blue light, while reflecting yellow and red light, and it is this that gives the metal its characteristic hue</font></span></p>

In atoms the charge distributions described by the wave function are rarely observed. The hydrogen atom is unique, since it only has one electron and, in a dc electric field, the Stark Hamiltonian is exactly separable in terms of parabolic coordinates (&eta;, &xi;, &phi;). As a result, the microscopic wave function along the &xi; coordinate that exists in the vicinity of the atom, and the projection of the continuum wave function measured at a macroscopic distance, share the same nodal structure. In this Letter, we report photoionization microscopy experiments where this nodal structure is directly observed.

Such problems are not unusual in materials science. Some were able, I contend, to get the experiment to work (for example, <a href="http://www.lenr.org/acrobat/McKubreMCHisothermala.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="vcard author"><span class="fn">M.

But it could be argued that the experiments never excluded the possibility that the liberated energy might be taken up directly by the metal lattice within which the hydrogen molecules were absorbed. </font></font></span></font></font></font></span></span></span></font></span></font></span></span></span></p>

This meant that most scientists were denied a view of the accumulating positive evidence. The result? Fleischmann was effectively denied the credit due to him, and doomed to become the tragic figure in Ball&#39;s account.&quot;</font></font></span></font></font></font></span></span></span></font></span></font></span></span></span></p>

According to the following equation, the reaction requires: water; a metallic oxidizing agent such as aluminum pellets to produce heat and hydrogen; a proprietary carbon catalyst to lower the activation energy and accelerate the rate of reaction; a thermal source to initiate the reaction; and a continuous source of low level DC voltage to reduce the formation of a reaction-inhibiting layer of aluminum hydroxide layer on the aluminum pellets. ... The critical and proprietary aspect of the technology is the catalytic carbon named by the developer as Catalytic Carbon (CC). To begin the reaction, an external source of heat is applied to the system. Once hydrogen production begins, the temperature of the system starts to rise. The Catalytic Carbon, which increases the rate of this reaction, simultaneously causes a rapid rise in the temperature of the system. This heat is sufficient to maintain the reaction without an external source of energy.</span></font></font><font size="3"><span lang="EN"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;</font></span></font><font face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Calibri" size="3"><span lang=""> </span></font></font></span></font></font></font></font></span></font></font></p>

The loose electron then can be harnessed through wires to provide an electrical current.&nbsp; MIT&rsquo;s new technique has each photon can knocking two electrons loose. This makes the process much more efficient: In a standard cell, any excess energy carried by a photon is wasted as heat, whereas in the new system the extra energy goes into producing two electrons instead of one.&nbsp; ... The team uses an organic compound called pentacene in an organic solar cell in a kind of &quot;coating&quot; for a conventional optical trapping scheme.

			<p><font size="5"><span lang=""><font size="3">March 7, &nbsp;2013 - &quot;</font><font face="Calibri"><font face="Calibri"><font size="3">At some point during the fall of 2010 there was a large policy shift in hedging crude oil on the NYMEX futures exchange by the big banks and the oil companies. Up to that point the hedgers of crude have largely been the producers as they want to hedge their production against future price movements. On the buy side there was the big financial institutions (Swap Dealers = JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, etc), and the money managers (large pension funds, hedge funds, etc.), that speculate in a price increase. </font><font size="3">But during the fall of 2010 this state of affairs changed. From being net-long 200 thousand contracts, the banks became net-short in a couple of months. Their selling has since continued. And now, by March 2013, they are net-short 300 thousand contracts (300 million barrels of oil = $30 billion). See the green lines in the chart above. </font><font size="3">... </font><font size="3">Something real is going on, but what? W</font><font size="3">hy are the producers abandoning their decade long hedging strategy? ... </font><font size="3">What if the first customer of Rossi actually is the US Navy? What if the US Navy know for sure that the 1MW E-cat works (because they have bought several)? What if they actually knew this even before the first public demo of the E-Cat in January 2011? Since the test was decided upon sometime during the fall of 2010 and Rossi himself says he had run a heater in a Bologna factory during a year before that, it looks reasonable. So let&rsquo;s assume that this is the case.&nbsp; </font><font size="3">It is certainly in the big banks interest to know about these things,....</font><font size="3">LENR might already be a technological fact on the industrial scale, and not further away in time than the banks can manage to keep it secret. This makes a huge difference on the outcome. Maybe this is exactly what they know. It certainly would not be surprising if they have verified the E-Cat and actively trade on that information. The information advantage is huge and so are the potential profits.&quot;</font></font></font></span></font><font size="5"><strong> </strong></font></p>

			<p><span lang=""><span lang="">&quot;The recent widespread adoption of compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) has increased their importance as a source of environmental Hg. Stable isotope analysis can identify the sources of environmental Hg, but the isotopic composition of Hg from CFL is not yet known. Results from analyses of CFL with a range of hours of use show that the Hg they contain is isotopically fractionated in a unique pattern during normal CFL operation. This fractionation is large by comparison to other known fractionating processes for Hg and has a distinctive, mass-independent signature, such that CFL Hg could be uniquely identified from other sources. The fractionation process described here may also explain anomalous fractionation of Hg isotopes in precipitation.&quot;</span></span></p>

They showed that under certain conditions, real photons are generated in pairs, and concluded that their creation was consistent with quantum field theory predictions.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; they had to ensure that the origin of the noise is quantum and not some unaccounted source of excess noise, such as thermal imbalance between the environment and the sample, or possibly leakage of external noise.&nbsp; ... Modulating the effective length of the cavity by flux-biasing the SQUID&nbsp;&nbsp;(superconducting quantum interference device) metamaterial had its challenges as well. &quot;</font></span></p>

Four different reactor chambers were built, in which different forms of nickel were tested in contact with hydrogen at different pressures and temperatures. Some of the nickel samples also contained other metal as &quot;catalysts&quot; like lithium, potassium and irons. In some of our samples the nickel was e.g In micrometer large crystal grains, In other samples the nickel was In the form of nanometer grains embedded in zirconium oxide. Contacts were taken with many active researchers in the field, including Andrea Rossi, asking for guidance to find a functioning solution. Andrea Rossi could not reveal his catalyst for us but thought that we would get a small indicative response using just pure nickel and hydrogen. He also mentioned that a hydrogen pressure of at least 200 bar and a temperature of 500 &deg;C was necessary in order to see any effect without the catalyst. Piantelli, who is another researcher in the field has stated that &quot;No catalyst is necessary. The trick is In the preparation of the nickel&quot;.

			<p>Feb. 22, 2013 - &quot;The mainstream media or at least tech media has finally picked up on the low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) or cold fusion work being done at NASA and some of its implications. At least three stories about Joseph Zawodndy&rsquo;s work at the Langley Research Center in Virginia are floating around online. ... This media attention indicates that NASA is serious about LENR and might soon be able to produce some sort of credible evidence to back up these claims. ... Dennis Bushnell as saying that 1% of the world&rsquo;s nickel production could meet the world&rsquo;s energy needs at a quarter of the cost of coal if LENR is perfected.&quot;</p>

And after the heating events take place, the total mass of what was in the heat chamber goes down. So it&rsquo;s claimed that the thermal energy that was produced must be explained by e=mc2.

These effects are observed at conventional temperatures (60 &deg; C-1500 &deg; C), which suggest a nuclear origin, and in any case much more energy than chemistry (50 to 1000 times more chemicals). Yet it does not look like the fusion of stars, or the fission nuclear reactors.

It attracted much media buzz, much hope for an energy revolution.

			<p align="left"><span lang="">Jan. 28, 2013 - On day 5, Dr. Mitchell Swartz continued with the substantial experimental proof for cold fusion (lattice assisted nuclear reactions). After discussion of the materials involved in the desired reactions, he surveyed the methods of calibration of heat producing reactions including the copious controls, time-integration, thermal waveform reconstruction, noise measurement and additional techniques, as well as those methods which are not accurate. Many examples of excess heat generated by CF/LANR systems were shown, using aqueous nickel and palladium systems. Then using the Navier Stokes equation, he developed the flow equations for both &quot;conventional&quot; cold fusion and codeposition. Optimal operating point operation was shown to have the ability to determine the products, and how the OOP manifolds demonstrate that CF is a reproducible phenomenon, applicable to science and engineering.

Successful energy transfer was demonstrated to require interactions of all the atoms in the lattice. For further analysis, a donor-receptor system was then included. At that point, he showed how the Coulomb barrier need not be overcome, because by this method the factor is linear, rather than quadratic (needed for classical analysis of D+D interactions).&nbsp; Supporting this analysis is the Karabut data in glow discharge on Pd&nbsp;which yielded both diffuse emissions and collimated x-radiation. with beamlets of energy bandwidth which were consistent with the theory Prof. Hagelstein developed. Finally, he used the Foldy-Wouthuysen rotational operation, and demonstrated&nbsp;how this analysis is becoming assymptotic with what is being observed in CF/LANR, with the use of his&nbsp;corrected&nbsp;condensed matter nuclear science (CMNS) Hamiltonian. Finally, with the addition of nonlinear Rabi oscillations (which yields Dicke superradiance), his model was shown to also be near-complete and&nbsp;consistent&nbsp;with both the observed pulse emissions and the wide bandwidth. </span></span></font></span></span></p>

However it was Pons and Fleischmann (P&amp;F) who captured the world&rsquo;s attention when they announced the discovery of Cold Fusion at a well-attended Press Conference. This created much notoriety at the time - landing them on the cover of Time magazine. In retrospect, it was probably a premature announcement, since the effect was known to be difficult to reproduce.

			<p>Jan. 26, 2013 - &quot;A new measurement finds that the proton is about 4 percent smaller than previous experiments suggest. ... For years, physicists have used two indirect methods to determine the size of the proton. They can fire an electron beam at protons and measure how far the flying particles get deflected. Alternatively, physicists can study the behavior of electrons in hydrogen atoms. They shoot a laser at an atom so that the one electron jumps to a higher, unstable energy level; when the electron returns to a low-energy state, it releases X-rays whose frequency depends on the size of the proton. Both methods suggest the proton has a radius of about 0.88 femtometers, or 0.88 quadrillionths of a meter.&nbsp; That measurement was not in doubt until 2010, when physicist Aldo Antognini at ETH Zurich and his team developed a new technique to probe proton size. They also used hydrogen atoms, but replaced the electrons with muons &mdash; particles similar to electrons but more than 200 times as massive. ... After measuring the X-rays emitted by muons shifting between energy states, Antognini&rsquo;s team published a paper in Nature saying that the proton radius is 0.84 femtometers &mdash; about 4 percent less than previous estimates. ... . The new study eliminates the possibility of certain systematic errors and reduces the measurement&rsquo;s uncertainty by 40 percent.&quot;</p>

			<p class="column-center-inner">&quot;Another short course in cold fusion will be offered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in late January. The course: Cold Fusion 101: Introduction to Excess Power in Fleischmann-Pons Experiments will be conducted by long low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) enthusiast and Electrical Engineering Professor Peter Hagelstein and inventor Mitchell Swartz of Jet Energy. Swartz is the man who built the Jet Energy NANOR that was displayed and tested in Hagelstein&#39;s laboratory at MIT last year. This is the second year in which the course will be held. Last year&#39;s course was attended by Canadian patent attorney David J. French. French was so impressed with the course that he wrote a report called Conclusively Demonstrating the Energy Effect of Cold Fusion.&quot;</p>

One of the greatest changes that a self-contained energy producer would facilitate would be the ability to live with greater independence from the grid structures of society. ... The systems being sold today and the ones foreseen in the next ten years or so based on known technologies under development will not offer the independence of the self-contained units that are being considered possible given evidence over the last few years in the new energy field. ...

But the team also adjusted the trapping laser field to make it more energetically favourable for the atoms to stick in their positions. ....

			Nov. 10, 2012 - &quot;Being able to replicate a scientific discovery is one of the mainstays of the scientific method.

The number of documented replications runs in the thousands.&nbsp; ... Cold fusion is now being developed like a business, including reluctance to share information to potential competitors and closely guarded trade secrets and concomitantly, absolutely no obligation to the public at large to share findings or methods.&quot;

There have been only a few exhibits and demonstrations at previous ICCFs.&nbsp; Reiko&nbsp; Notoya had a Ni&nbsp; light-water electrochemical&nbsp; cell&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp; display&nbsp; at&nbsp;&nbsp; ICCF3.&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp; ICCF10, Mitchell Swartz&nbsp; and Gayle&nbsp; Verner (Jet Energy Inc.)&nbsp; ran&nbsp; a demonstration of their LANR PHUSORT&nbsp; at&nbsp; a site&nbsp; near the&nbsp; meeting. It produced excess&nbsp; power of about one-third of a watt with an energy gain&nbsp; of&nbsp; 2.3.&nbsp; At&nbsp; that same&nbsp; conference, Dennis Letts (LettsLab) controlled&nbsp; an&nbsp; experiment in&nbsp; his&nbsp; Texas&nbsp; laboratory over&nbsp; the&nbsp; internet from the&nbsp; podium during his&nbsp; presentation.&nbsp; ICCF17&nbsp; was&nbsp; distinguished by having a sophisticated demonstration operating in&nbsp; the&nbsp; meeting room throughout the&nbsp; conference. Francesco Celani from the&nbsp; Frascati National&nbsp; Laboratory took his&nbsp; experiment from Italy&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; National Instruments meeting in Austin, Texas,&nbsp; the&nbsp; week&nbsp; before ICCF17, and operated it successfully there. .... The demonstration was powered by 48 watts and produced up to 18 watts of excess&nbsp; power during the&nbsp; conference. ... The&nbsp; different kinds of evidence for&nbsp; the&nbsp; occurrence of LENR have different credence to&nbsp; different people, depending on their interests. For example, measurements of transmutations, or the&nbsp; emission of energetic particles or radiation, are of great&nbsp; scientific interest, but&nbsp; might not be of practical value in&nbsp; the&nbsp; near future. That is, they tend to&nbsp; interest only scientists.&nbsp; However, the&nbsp; generation of excess&nbsp; heat is important for both scientific and pragmatic, even commercial, reasons.&quot;</font></font></div>

The new dynamic duo of cold fusion is SRI International chemist Michael McKubre and MIT physicist Peter Hagelstein.&nbsp; Its biggest problem is the lack of reproducibility, even in the experiments of the most respected members of the cold fusion community.

			<p>Oct. 21, 2012 - <i>Forbes</i> -&quot;Cold fusion, otherwise called Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR), is, theoretically, the fusing together (rather than a chemical reaction) of elements at &quot;normal&quot; temperatures such that they release more energy than is required to fuse them.&nbsp; .... Hot fusion, on the other hand, is the process by which elements would be fused together at temperatures and pressures only found naturally in stars..... Hot fusion is also guaranteed to have radioactive waste products. Unfortunately it turned out that the Fleischmann and Pons experiment was not reliably reproducible. In the academic fracas that followed, both men&#39;s reputations were ruined and the field was quickly relegated to the domain of &quot;fringe&quot; science along with perpetual motion, telekinesis, and anti-gravity. While mainstream science was apparently quite happy with this situation and went about spending billions of dollars on &quot;hot&quot; fusion (there are many who claim that cold fusion was systematically marginalized and deprecated by establishment scientists), a few &quot;rogue&quot; researchers continued with cold fusion research and, over the last few years, evidence has piled up that cold fusion may, in fact, be real.&quot;</p>

Fast forward to February 2012, the mysterious Majorana fermion was detected in a nanowire, according to Dutch nanoscientist Leo Kouwenhoven. The discovery could confirm the theory that assumes that dark matter, which is thought to form about 73 percent of the Universe, is composed of Majorana fermions. ....The recipe was simple: take one nanowire (made by colleagues from Eindhoven University of Technology) and add a superconducting material and a strong magnetic field.&quot;

Its also known the muon isn&#39;t finished at one pair, a muon can go on to drive a fusion better than 300 more times. .....The catch has been getting the muons.&quot;</p>

			<p>Sept 25,&nbsp; 2012 - &quot;ITER will be ready to test its fusion reactor in about 2019 or 2020, and will trigger the reaction by containing the plasma fuel in powerful magnetic fields, and then heating it with particle beams and radio waves. NIF has already started testing its design, whereby it uses a very powerful laser pulse to crush a tiny capsule filled with plasma. Unfortunately it has not yet achieved any significant levels of energy production.&nbsp; Researchers at the Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico, are on track to test their reactor before the end of 2013, and have high hopes that it will reach break-even.&nbsp; .... The process involves placing a tiny cylinder, about 7mm in diameter, filled with the deuterium and tritium plasma, inside their Z machine. The Z machine is an electrical pulse generator, capable of delivering 26 million amps in a short pulse lasting just milliseconds. As the vast current passes along the walls of the cylinder it creates a magnetic field that exerts a huge force on the walls, instantly crushing the cylinder and compressing the fuel inside. After initial tests the scientists discovered that the Z machine was not powerful enough to produce sufficient heat to trigger a break even reaction.&quot;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;Sept. 22, 2012&nbsp; - &quot;The commercialization of [LANR or] cold fusion will have a profound effect on many sectors of the economy and many industries. .... One of the first sectors to be impacted by cold fusion would be electricity production. Robert Godes the President of Brillouin has predicted that his company&#39;s LENR boiler technology could replace coal burning boilers in power plants in a few years. This would be a sea change in energy use it if it takes place.&nbsp; .... The replacement of natural gas with LENR wouldn&#39;t be as fast as some people think because natural gas is still fairly cheap. Many people would wait until their existing water heaters or furnaces wore out to replace them.&nbsp; The big impact would be on propane use because propane is very expensive.&quot;</p>

			Sept. 14, 2012 - &quot;A lot has been happening in the world of cold fusion, or Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) since our last update. Andrea Rossi, who claims to have a working commercial cold fusion reactor, finally released a report with seemingly independent scientific confirmation of the reaction in his device. ... Unlike Rossi, Celani does not claim to have a secret catalyst, just a nickel wire loaded with hydrogen which produces more heat than is supplied to it. The 62 watts output from 48 watts input isn&#39;t going to boil a kettle, but it was a very open demonstration, and unlike Rossi, Celani has plenty of theoretical physics to support it.&quot;</div>

SGS is a company that provides inspections, testing, certification and training for scientific research and consumer products. The 10 kilowatt consumer steam generator has been more difficult to certify due to the safety considerations when utilizing a hydrogen tank. The new Hot Cat reactor can withstand up to 1200 Celsius degrees and a special paint was invented specifically for use in the E-cat. Internal temperature can reach 1250 Celsius degrees while external surface can reach 1050 C.&nbsp; Inner core has dimensions length 33 cm, outer diameter 9 cm, inner diameter 3 cm made of AISI 310 steel to withstand higher temperatures.&quot;</p>

			<font size="+0">August 31, 2012 - &quot;Accounts of the cold fusion claims of the Czech-born electrochemist Martin Fleischmann, who has died aged 85, and his American-French former student Stanley Pons often assert that their results could not be replicated. This implies that their original experiments, carried out at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, in the 1980s were flawed. Cold fusion has since come to be commonly regarded as a delusion, but the true situation is more complicated. The Fleischmann-Pons experiments were motivated by the idea that hydrogen fusion, the source of the sun&#39;s heat, which goes very slowly at ordinary temperatures, might go significantly faster if the nuclei involved were brought closer together, as when hydrogen is absorbed at high density in a material such as palladium. The project was more successful than anticipated: returning to the laboratory after one weekend, when the apparatus had been turned off, the pair found that so much heat had been produced that a large hole had been melted into the bench and concrete floor. As a precaution they reduced the scale of the experiment and announced their findings at a press conference in 1989.&nbsp; While the original nuclear claims appear to have been erroneous - it was not their area of expertise - the parallel claim relating to excess heat production is different. Some scientists failed to replicate this, but others were successful, notably Michael McKubre of SRI International, California. At the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, a nuclear product, tritium, was detected, indicating that nuclear processes were indeed occurring.&quot;</font></td>

			<p><a href="http://world.std.com/~mica/cftsci.html">&nbsp;Dr. Eugene Mallove: &quot;One important implication of cold fusion is that there are, at least, 300 gallons of gasoline equivalent in every gallon of ordinary water.&nbsp; If you take the heavy hydrogen contained in one gallon of water, normal water that you drink, or get at the pond or the lake or the ocean, and fuse that heavy hydrogen into helium, which is what is happening in cold fusion.&nbsp;</a><br />
			<a href="http://world.std.com/~mica/cftsci.html">This gives you heat, and that amount of heat is the equivalent of 300 gallons of gasoline.&nbsp; That means that in only one cubic kilometer of ocean, we have the energy equivalent of the entire known oil reserves on Earth.&nbsp; And that means total energy independence from any localized supply of oil plus the environmental benefit of not producing CO2 and&nbsp; other noxious pollutants.</a></p>

			August 29, 2012 - Michael McKubre: &quot;Science advances one funeral at a time, said Max Planck. Now Martin Fleischmann is gone, what&#39;s in store for cold fusion research? ...Once they die, the argument becomes depersonalised. I do think there is an opportunity here. The hostility might abate because Martin is gone. Fleischmann faced a backlash in 1989 when (the MSM purported that)&nbsp; he and Stanley Pons said they had achieved fusion - the process that powers stars - in a lab. A bold claim that brought scorn for years. They didn&#39;t really claim that. They claimed to have observed an anomalous excess of heat in a tabletop experiment - a palladium electrode loaded with heavy hydrogen, or deuterium. That heat was too great to be explained by chemistry. .....Fusion simply means the combining of light nuclei to make a bigger nucleus with a mass deficit, and that mass deficit shows up as heat. Today it&#39;s quite clear that there is some sort of fusion going on - but it is a fusion process that hitherto has not been considered by the mainstream physics community.&quot;</td>

He (through his wife&#39;s company Leonardo Co) was to provide the core technology (reactor) and us to build the engineering around it in a safe product, which we called Hyperion. In our contract, we deserved the right to distribute complete Hyperions globally, except US and military applications where Mr. Rossi had already some reservations.&nbsp; In the mean time, Rossi signed a contract with Ampenergo that was in conflict with our contract. Ampenergo would act like us in US, but due to their contract with Rossi, for the whole American continent exclusively. Ampenergo published their relationship with Rossi on 25 of June 2011, that created us a huge problem: our Greek-Canadian share holders were basing their investment on our company under the hypothesis that we could distribute products to Canada also.... Then Alex Xanthoulis, the CEO of our company, asked me if we can &quot;trigger the reaction&quot; without Rossi. ..... What most people do not know is that we got very big help from what had been published already in CF/LENR literature. &quot;</font>

			August 12, 2012&nbsp; - &quot;(T)he first speaker was Professor David J. Nagel. ...&quot;Cold Fusion&quot; just does not cover the field. Professor Nagel urged young people to get involved. There is so much being discovered now. ....Dr. Michael McKubre ...gave the next lecture. His subject was calorimetry. .... More heavyweights in the field spoke: Professor Jean-Paul Biberian on gas-loading experiments, Professor Yeong E. Kim on theory, and Professor Michael E. Melich and Professor David J. Nagel.&quot; &quot;&nbsp;<br />
			.... There are two reasons to do experiments on Cold Fusion. The first is scientific: to verify and understand the anomalous heat effect (AHE).&nbsp; The other reason is to produce a marketable product, something useful.&nbsp; And then there are the experiments that have a foot in each camp. The NANOR is such a device, and Professor Peter Hagelstein chose as his topic to discuss the NANOR, .... a device about the size of an electronic resistor that produces heat on-demand in a highly reproducible and consistent way. Professor Hagelstein was asked why the device was so small, and can we scale it up? He answered that it is a lot cheaper, and with quicker results, if experiments are done on small scale.&nbsp;<br />
			.... Naoko Takahashi presented a demonstration on how to prepare the surface of palladium to increase its permeability. She was sponsored by Toyota. ... David Kidwell rushed through a lecture at the end of the day in which he demonstrated a video of a Sterling motor that he had running (assisted ) on anomalous heat generated simply by pressurizing and depressurizing H2 and D2.&quot;

			<p>August, 24 2012 - &quot;In February, this column introduced a contentious possible new energy source called low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) or lattice-assisted nuclear reactions (LANR) - a process that was formerly called &#39;cold fusion&#39;. There have been enough developments in this arena over the past half year to warrant an update.....In June, the chief scientist at the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) Langley Research Center, Denis Bushnell, posted a brief commentary on &#39;Low-energy nuclear reactions: the realism and the outlook&#39; on Nasa&#39;s website. According to Bushnell, we now have &quot;over two decades of hundreds of experiments worldwide indicating heat and transmutations with minimal radiation and low energy input&quot;.....Meanwhile, at least six companies are engaged in &#39;Edisonian&#39; attempts to commercialise LENR/LANR devices that produce cheap, clean heat.&quot;</p>

			August 19, 2012 - &quot;Platinum is an excellent catalyst, though it does have a few problems. One of the biggest at the moment is that a violent labor dispute in South Africa sent the price skyrocketing. ....The Nanostellar team, led by Dr. Kyeongjae &quot;K.J.&quot; Cho, professor of materials science and engineering and physics at UT Dallas and co-founder of Nanostellar, determined that a mineral catalyst would be a cheaper alternative. ... Cho relates that computer modelling showed that mullite was a cost-effective substitute. Mullite is a silicate mineral discovered on the Isle of Mull, Scotland in 1924. It&#39;s rare in nature, but a synthetic version is produced commercially for use in various porcelains, such as crucibles and heating balls. It has a very high melting point of 1840 C (3344 F) and as a mixed-phase oxide mineral it makes a very attractive catalyst. In addition, laboratory tests indicate that converters using mullite would have 45 percent lower emissions than with platinum.&quot;

The potential impact of cold fusion is huge. Energy was approximately 10% of the total world gross domestic product of $60 trillion in 2006 (US Energy Information Administration 2009). The current world power use is 16 Terra Watts, and it would have to grow to 60 Terra Watts for everyone to enjoy western European standards of living. Experimental evidence suggests that this nuclear energy source has the potential to provide abundant, low cost energy without the production of greenhouse gasses or long-term hazardous waste. The minimal radiation detected from experiments can be easily shielded.&quot;</p>

			Dr. Peter Gluck</center>
			August 11, 2012 - &quot;The essence is that LENR is converted now from a Discovery (smart, surprising, confusing) to an Invention (very smart, creative, radical, controlled). It is a change of attitude from try and wait to change in a planned manner..... LENR is about the relationship between pairs- nuclear marriages of a metal and a gas; initially the mutual attraction between these is not high enough for a success, the participants have be changed in nature and in properties in order to become perfectly compatible. Obviously, not Defkalion has discovered this, from the ancient CF times, the metal (mainly palladium) was treated by very inventive methods. Admirable creativity was demonstrated by Arata. Ahern and many others in using nanotechnology for making palladium and alloys a better nuclear partner for deuterium and by Piantelli who has made a better choice of metal- nickel and has applied the highest science and even art of nanotechnology to force nickel to reveal its best properties and virtues in his process.&quot;

			August 9, 2012 - OilPrice.com - &quot;.... Pons and Fleishman could not consistently reproduce their results, and this led to the rejection of cold fusion, the discrediting of the two scientists by the general scientific community.&nbsp; Cold fusion became a complete dead end. Two different Department of Energy panels dismissed cold fusion theories and recommended against creating a program to study it.

			August 8, 2012&nbsp; US News - &quot;After decades of wandering in the scientific wilderness, cold fusion may be returning to the land of the acceptable.&nbsp; ...Cold fusion is, conceivably, a third type of nuclear reaction (after fission and so-called hot fusion) that somehow occurs at relatively low temperatures. When Pons and Fleischmann, two of the world&#39;s leading electrochemists at the time, reported in 1989 that their tabletop, experimental apparatus had produced anomalous heat that could only be explained by some sort of a nuclear process, the race to define or explain cold fusion began. Pons and Flesichmann also reported that they&#39;d observed small amounts of nuclear reaction byproducts.&nbsp; .... But what has inspired hope within this small community are several recent developments: LENR demonstration projects recently initiated at respected places like MIT, the University of Missouri, and the University of Bologna....&nbsp; is cold fusion back in the game?&quot;</td>

			Akito Takahashi, Technova Inc.- The Kobe-Technova team has worked to elucidate the underlying physics of anomalous heat evolution effects in deuterium (D) and protium (H) gas-loaded nano-metal-compound systems. Basic tools are the twin D(H) gas-loading equipment and the supporting theoretical modeling by the TSC multibody fusion theory. Using various Pd-based and Ni-based nanofabricated samples, the team has reproducibly observed anomalous heat effects with isotopic differences using time-dependent (dynamic) data of thermal-power evolutions, D(H)/metal-atom loading ratios, and their temperature dependence (for Ni-based cases).&nbsp;<br />

By understanding the physics behind this lower energy nuclear reaction (LENR) phenomenon, researchers can control the reaction.
