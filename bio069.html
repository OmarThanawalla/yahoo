<H2>Reproductive Physiology, Conception, Prenatal Development</H2>

<P>The reproductive cycles of sexually-reproducing animals are influenced by a number of hormones, including follicle-stimulating hormone, leutinizing hormone, estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone, produced by the animals&#146; bodies.
 Additionally, reproductive cycles are influenced by environmental factors such as day length.  Since the hormone <B>melatonin</B> is only secreted in the dark, animals&#146; bodies produce more melatonin in winter
 months when there is less daylight.  Melatonin (or lack thereof) produces a number of physiological changes, including regulation of fertility in many species.
 In humans, melatonin levels drop 75% just before puberty, and it has been noted that blind girls whose brains/pineal glands do not receive light from their eyes have delayed onset of puberty.
 In many other species, melatonin controls sexual receptivity.  For example, ewes only are receptive in fall/winter so the lambs will be born in spring and have all summer to grow.  Typically, special sex <B>pheromones</B> are emitted to convey
 information about receptivity to members of the opposite sex or to regulate sexual cycles of other members of the same species.</P>

<P>Sperm production in males is under the control of <B>follicle-stimulating hormone</B> (FSH) and <B>leutinizing hormone</B> (LH).  LH stimulates production of androgens (including <B>testosterone</B>) by the testes, while FSH stimulates the testes to produce sperm.
 As in females, production of FSH and LH are under the control of <B>gonadotropin releasing hormone</B> (GnRH) produced by the hypothalamus.  Via a negative feedback loop, androgens control levels of GnRH, FSH, and LH.  Additionally, androgens are responsible for development of the male
 reproductive organs during embryonic development, development of secondary sexual characteristics (beard, deeper voice) and behaviors (singing in birds), and production of sperm.
 Also via negative feedback loops, FSH and LH control production of GnRH.  In human males, it appears that blood levels of all these hormones remain fairly constant, but in males of many other mammal species, blood levels of these hormones vary seasonally (hinting at involvement of melatonin in some way).</P>

<P>Thus, in a number of species of mammals, such as goats, deer, camels, and sheep, due to environmental and hormonal cues, the male periodically goes into
<A HREF="javascript:ShowIt('<B>Rut</B>:  a periodic sexual excitement in the male that is analogous to estrous in the female','(<B>rut</B> = a roaring)','../../sounds/bio105/rut.wav')" onMouseOver="window.status='Periodic sexual excitement in the male'; return true"><B>rut</B></A>,
 a periodic sexual excitement in the male that is analogous to estrous in the female.  Billy goats (bucks) in rut stink worse that they do at other times.  Buck deer are more likely to use their antlers to engage in sexual competition with other males.  People who work with camels know that male camels in rut become
 more unpredictable, meaner than usual, and harder to work with and control.</P>

<P>In most species of mammals, the female has either an
<A HREF="javascript:ShowIt('<B>estrous cycle</B>:  periodic sexual receptiveness in the female, followed by absorption of the unused endometrium','(<B>estrus</B> = frenzy, passion)','../../sounds/bio105/estrous.wav')" onMouseOver="window.status='Periodic sexual receptiveness in the female'; return true"><B>estrous cycle</B></A>
 or a
<A HREF="javascript:ShowIt('<B>menstrual cycle</B>:  cyclical sexual receptiveness in the female, followed by shedding of the unused endometrium','(<B>mensa</B> = month)','../../sounds/bio105/menstrual.wav')" onMouseOver="window.status='Cyclical sexual receptiveness in the female'; return true"><B>menstrual cycle</B></A>.
 An estrous cycle is also called &#147;being in heat&#148; because the female&#146;s body temperature rises a
 little.  However, more pronounced than changes in temperature are noticable behavioral changes.  If the female does not become pregnant, the <B>endometrium</B> is reabsorbed and (usually) there is no &#147;bleeding&#148;.  In species in which the female
 has a menstrual cycle, the unused endometrium is shed and voided from the body as the <B>menses</B> or period or menstrual flow.  Note that while this term was derived in the context of human females who happen to cycle in
 about the same length of time as a lunar month, it is also applied to other species whose cycles are not one month long.  Most other species have cycles that are shorter or longer than a month, and in some species, the timing of ovulation and female
 receptivity is so tied to environmental cues (light, temperature, etc.) that they only cycle and mate at one or two specific times of the year.  Human females are somewhat unusual because the females of most species are only receptive around the time of
 ovulation (release of a fertile egg).  A human female is more receptive around the time of ovulation, but that is not the only time she is receptive.  Human females generally are receptive to sexual activity throughout their cycles.</P>

<P>The average menstrual cycle in humans ranges about 20 to 40 days in length, with a statistical average of about 28 to 29 days.  Some women experience regular cycles, while others are quite irregular.  Much is understood about the hormones involved in
 the female cycle, but we are only beginning to understand the role of <B>pheromones</B>.  It is well-known that the cycles of college women living in a dorm situation frequently adjust such that many of the women &#147;have their periods&#148; at the
 same time as each other.  It has been shown experimentally that when perspiration from one woman is dissolved in alcohol and applied above the upper lip of other females (several times a week), their cycles all adjust to coincide with hers.  There is
 also experimental evidence that frequent exposure (several times a week) to male perspiration (therefore, pheromones) can regulate a female&#146;s cycle, causing irregular, short, or long cycles to become more regular and closer to the 28 to 29 day average.
 This would make sense evolutionarily because it would increase a woman&#146;s chances of conceiving if she was in a situation where she had frequent contact with a stable, supportive mate who could provide her and her child with enough food to survive (at a
 time when she would be more vulnerable and less able to gather food herself, yet need more than usual).</P>

<P>By convention, the first day of a woman&#146;s period is considered to be day 1 of her cycle.  The first 3 to 7 days are generally the <B>menstrual flow phase</B>, and during this time, all hormones involved are at low levels.  There are five
 hormones involved in controlling the female cycle.  These are <B>gonadotropin releasing hormone</B> (GnRH) secreted by the hypothalamus, <B>follicle-stimulating hormone</B> (FSH) and <B>lutenizing hormone</B> (LH) secreted by the pituitary gland, and 
 <B>estrogen</B> and <B>progesterone</B> secreted by the ovaries.  The following diagrams and explanation show how levels of these hormones and the changes they induce vary throughout a woman&#146;s cycle.</P>

<P>The first half of a woman&#146;s cycle is the <B>proliferative phase (follicular phase)</B>, during which the endometrium starts to thicken.  The pituitary secretes FSH which causes (usually one) follicle to mature and the ovaries to secrete
 estrogen.  The ovarian estrogen secretion gradually increases until just prior to ovulation.
  This gradually supresses secretion of FSH and stimulates the hypothalamus to secrete a larger amount of GnRH which, in turn, triggers the pituitary to secrete a
 burst of LH, causing <B>ovulation</B>.  During the proliferative phase, a woman&#146;s body temperature is low, perhaps as low as 98.0&#176 F (36.7&#176; C) or less.  Sometimes there is a slight rise near the end
 of the phase during the pre-ovulatory burst of LH before it dips again at ovulation.  Throughout this phase, the cervical mucus becomes progressively clearer and thinner.</P>

<P>On about day 14 of an average 28-day cycle, <B>ovulation</B>, the rupture of the follicle and release of the egg, occurs in response to the surge of LH.  LH stimulates the remaining follicle cells to form a
<A HREF="javascript:ShowIt('<B>Corpus Luteum</B>:  temporary secretory structure which forms from remains of ovarian follicle','(<B>corpus</B> = body; <B>luteo</B> = yellow)','../../sounds/bio105/luteum.wav')" onMouseOver="window.status='Remains of ovarian follicle'; return true"><B>corpus luteum</B></A>
 after ovulation.  Often at ovulation there is a sharp drop in the woman&#146;s body temperature and her cervical mucus becomes very thin and clear and forms &#147;threads&#148;.  Interestingly, both the low body temperature and
 the condition of the mucus are designed to prolong the life of and aid in the mobility of sperm to increase the chances that the egg being released will be fertilized.</P>

<P>The second half of the cycle is called the <B>secretory phase</B> in the uterus and the <B>luteal phase</B> in the ovaries.  The endometrium continues to build up due to the secretion of progesterone (and estrogen) by the corpus
 luteum, and this prepares the uterus for a possible pregnancy.  In case an egg has been fertilized, the growing embryo needs a warmer environment to do well, so the body temperature rises to 98.6&#176; F (37.0&#176; C) or higher.  The cervical mucus becomes thick
 and paste-like, blocking any more sperm from entering the uterus.</P>

<P>If an egg is not fertilized, as the corpus luteum deteriorates at the end of a cycle, both estrogen and progesterone levels go very low.  In a pregnancy, implantation triggers hormone production that keeps the corpus luteum
 secreting estrogen and progesterone for a while, but without that, the corpus luteum disintegrates and stops secreting these hormones.  At this time, all of the hormone levels are low and decreasing.  This frequently causes the mood swings
 and other symptoms of <B>premenstrual syndrome (PMS)</B>, but PMS is also affected by diet, and large amounts of salt, sugar, yeast, and/or caffeine can make things worse.</P>

<P>Throughout this discussion, the roles of the five hormones that influence a woman&#146;s menstrual cycle have been mentioned, but their interactions are quite complex and involve both positive and negative feedback loops.  Reiterating the previous
 discussion specifically from the point of view of the female hormone cycle will hopefully aid in better understanding the roles played by these hormones.</P>

<OL>  
<LI>GnRH from the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary to produce FSH.
<LI>During the first part of pre-ovulatory phase, the pituitary secretes low levels of FSH.
<LI>FSH stimulates growth and maturation of a follicle.
<LI>As the follicle grows and matures, it secretes estrogen in increasing amounts.
<LI>The rising levels of estrogen exert negative feedback on the pituitary to gradually lower the levels of FSH.
<LI>However, estrogen exerts a positive feedback effect on the hypothalamus.
<LI>Thus, just before ovulation, the hypothalamus secretes a larger amount of releasing hormone which causes the pituitary to secrete a burst of LH.
<LI>The effect of this burst of LH on the mature follicle causes it to rupture, release the egg, and start to form a corpus luteum.
<LI>After ovulation, LH stimulates the corpus luteum to secrete progesterone and estrogen to prepare the uterus for implantation.
<LI>The rising/high levels of the estrogen-progesterone combination in the blood exert a negative feedback effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary, causing levels of LH to decrease.
<LI>As LH decreases, the corpus luteum starts to disintegrate.
<LI>Unless an embryo has implanted, near the end of the post-ovulatory phase, without the stimulation of LH, the corpus luteum stops producing estrogen and progesterone.  Thus the endometrium is no longer maintained and begins to deteriorate and is shed.
<LI>Thus, around the time a woman&#146;s period starts, all five hormones are at their lowest levels.
<LI>However with the low estrogen and progesterone levels, the hypothalamus can now begin again to secrete GnRH so the cycle starts over.
<LI>If an egg was fertilized, it begins to divide as it travels down the Fallopian tube, and the <B>blastocyst</B> that reaches the uterus is about 100 cells in size and ready to implant in the endometrium.
<LI>If implantation is successful, the outer embryonic membrane, the <B>chorion</B> secretes <B>human chorionic gonadotropin</B> (HCG) which maintains the corpus luteum during the first trimester of pregnancy.  Excess HCG is excreted in the woman&#146;s urine,
 thus many pregnancy tests test for the presence of HCG in urine.
<LI>During the second trimester, the placenta starts to secrete progesterone and stops HCG production.  Because of the lack of HCG, the corpus luteum, which is no longer needed, degenerates.  The endometrium is maintained by the hormones secreted by the
 placenta.
</OL>

<P><B>Copulation</B> in most species of animals is preceded by various <B>courtship rituals</B> which help insure that the most genetically fit individuals pass on their genes.
 In humans, various activities including &#147;flirting&#148; and &#147;foreplay&#148; lead up to and physiologically stimulate and prepare the couple&#146;s bodies for coitus, and
 in general, most women need considerably more stimulation over a longer period of time than many men, to physiologically prepare their bodies for sexual intercourse.
 Human mating physiology includes four phases in the <B>sexual response cycle</B>.</P>
<OL>  
<LI>The <B>excitement phase</B> prepares the vagina and penis for <B>coitus</B> or sexual intercourse.  <B>Vasoconstriction</B>, filling of the erectile tissue with blood occurs because of increased flow in the arteries and constriction of the veins,
 especially in the penis and clitoris, but also in the testes, ovaries, female labia minora, and female breasts.
<A HREF="javascript:ShowIt('<B>Myotonia</B>:  increased muscle tension','(<B>myo</B> = muscle; <B>tono</B> = tone, tension, stretched)','../../sounds/bio105/myotonia.wav')" onMouseOver="window.status='Increased muscle tension'; return true"><B>Myotonia</B></A>,
 increased muscle tension, causes erection of the nipples;
 tension in the arms, legs, and other skeletal muscles; and sustained or rhythmic contractions of the smooth (and skeletal) muscles.
<LI>Many of these characteristics continue into the <B>plateau phase</B>.  In the female, the outer third of the vagina becomes vasoconstricted, while the inner two thirds becomes slightly expanded, and the uterus becomes elevated, all in preparation for receiving
 sperm.  Breathing and heart rates increase, not because of physical activity, but because of stimualtion from the autonomic (sympathetic) nervous system.
<LI><B>Orgasm</B> is rhythmic, involuntary contractions of the reproductive structures/organs in both sexes.  In the male, this occurs in two stages:  <B>emission</B>, in which the semen is injected into the urethra; and <B>ejaculation</B>, in which the
 semen is propelled into the woman&#146;s vagina.  A male normally has only one orgasm (and some men may fall asleep during/after the resolution phase which follows).  In the female, orgasm involves the uterus and outer vagina but not the upper two thirds of the
 vagina.  Typically it is harder to stimulate a woman to reach orgasm, and the man needs to take care to make sure the woman is ready when he is.  Women, however, can have multiple orgasms, and once aroused, are often not ready to &#147;quit&#148; when, physiologically, the man&#146;s body is progressing to the resolution phase.  Many women appreciate continued, gentle stimulation after coitus.
<LI>The <B>resolution phase</B> involves a return to normal.  During the resolution phase, vasoconstriction returns to normal, the muscles relax, etc.  While the changes that occur in most structures occur within the first 5 min. after orgasm, loss of
 the male erection often takes a little longer.
</OL>

<P>If the woman is just pre-ovulation or at ovulation, <B>conception</B>, the start of a new person, of pregnancy, may occur.  Interestingly, there are some things a couple can do to increase their chances of having a baby of a given sex.  It has been found that sperm
 which contain an X chromosome tend to live longer than Y sperm, so having intercourse a couple days prior to ovulation increases the chances of a girl baby.  On the other hand, Y sperm swim faster than X sperm, so having intercourse right at ovulation
 can increase the chances of a boy baby.  As previously mentioned, at the time of ovulation, a woman&#146;s body temperature and cervical mucus are &#147;right&#148; to help sperm survive.  The contractions caused by orgasm and the prostaglandins in semen help
 propel sperm up into the uterus, and from there, up the Fallopian tubes.  An egg is fertilized near the end of the Fallopian tube, then finishes meiosis, the nuclei unite, and the embryo starts dividing as it begins to travel to the uterus.</P>

<P>Recent work on human pheromones has turned up some interesting effects they may have on pregnancy.  It is not unusual in our busy society, for a couple who desire a baby to keep track of where the woman is in her cycle, and plan to have intercourse
 &#147;at the right time,&#148; yet, despite no physical problems, many of these couples still fail to conceive.  Recent work on human pheromones suggests that this is not enough.  Apparently the woman&#146;s body may need continued exposure to the man&#146;s
 pheromones, such as would be acheived by the close contact during coitus, several times a week during the last two weeks of her cycle to make implantation more likely.  Again, evolutionarily, this would make sense in terms of signaling the presence of
 a pair-bonded male who could provide her and her developing child with enough food to survive the pregnancy.  It would, then, make sense that lack of continued pheromonal stimulation (as in when the couple go back to their busy schedule until next month
 at the appointed time or in a &#147;one night stand&#148;) would signal the absence of a male that could mean increased hardship and lower chances of survival if pregnancy were to result.  However, in the interest of passing on one&#146;s genes, 
 evolutionarily, the possibility of pregnancy is not totally ruled out, just diminished.</P>

<P>If an egg is fertilized, fertilization occurs in the far end of the Fallopian tube near the ovary, and as the embryo travels down the tube, cell division starts.  By the time it reaches the uterus (about
 a week later), it is a &#147;hollow ball&#148; or
<A HREF="javascript:ShowIt('<B>blastocyst</B>:  hollow ball stage of embryonic development','(<B>blasto</B> = bud, sprout)','../../sounds/bio105/blastocyst.wav')" onMouseOver="window.status='Hollow ball stage of embryonic development'; return true"><B>blastocyst</B></A>,
 which has about 100 cells.  The embryo, specifically the placenta, starts producing hormones which prevent the corpus luteum from disintegrating, and hormones from the
 corpus luteum maintain the endometrium until the placenta is large enough to secrete more hormones on its own.
 Note that whereas <B>contraceptives</B>, as their name suggests, prevent conception (union of egg and sperm to form a new person), <B>intrauterine devices</B> (IUDs) as well as &#147;morning after&#148; pills and some other drugs, including Depo-Provera, work to prevent 
 implantation of the week-old, genetically-unique, growing embryo thereby causing it to die, and thus are <B>abortifacients</B>.</P>


<P>When the embryo implants in the endometrium, it starts to form the placenta.  A human placenta attains the size of a dinner plate.  The placenta serves as the site of transfer of nutrients and wastes between the maternal and fetal blood, and when large enough, it secretes hormones to maintain the endometrium, thus the pregnancy.  Keep in mind that
 the two blood supplies do not come into contact with each other, but chemicals can be passed back and forth.</P>

<P>In the <B>first trimester</B> (the first three months) of pregnancy, most <B>organogenesis</B>, development of body organs occurs.  The baby&#146;s heart starts beating at about four weeks (when the mother&#146;s first period is about two
 weeks late and she&#146;s beginning to suspect she might be pregnant).  Because so much critical growth and development takes place in the first few weeks before she even knows she&#146;s pregnant, it is very important that she be well nourished (including vitamin
 supplements if needed, especially folic acid to prevent neural tube defects) before she even tries to get pregnant.  By the end of the eighth week (when her second period is two weeks overdue) all of the major body structures and organs of an adult are present in at least rudimentary
 form, so the embryo is now called a <B>fetus</B>.  The rest of the time during pregnancy is mostly just growth.  Note that because of organogenesis, the first trimester is the time when the growing baby is the most sensitive to adverse effects of drugs like 
 alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, viruses like German measles, and lack of necessary nutrients such as folacin.  During the first trimester, the placenta secretes HCG to maintain the corpus luteum which continues to secrete the estrogen and especially progesterone
 needed to maintain the endometrium.  The cervical plug forms to protect the growing baby from &#147;foreign invaders&#148;, and the woman&#146;s breasts begin to enlarge in preparation for <B>lactation</B>, or nursing.  The level of HCG is so high in the
 blood that some is excreted in the urine.  Most pregnancy tests look for the presence of HCG in urine.  As the sex organs begin to develop, the embryo starts with rudimentary forms of both male and female systems, and only one set continues to develop
 while the other atrophies.  Also the initial development of external genitalia is similar and it can be difficult to tell the sex of a baby early on.</P>

<P>In the <B>second trimester</B> growth occurs.  The baby is very active, and eventually these movements can be felt by the mother.  The baby can hear by the fourth month, and when born recognizes not only mom&#146;s voice, but also
 dad&#146;s voice (if he&#146;s around) and/or any other frequently-heard, familiar sounds, perhaps including things like any musical instruments the mother plays, etc.  During this trimester, HCG production declines and the corpus luteum stops producing
 progesterone as it deteriorates.  As this is happening, the placenta takes over and  begins to secretes progesterone itself to maintain the endometrium.</P>

<P>The <B>third trimester</B> is a time of rapid growth.  The baby tends to move less just because the uterus has become so crowded.  Estrogen levels in the mother&#146;s blood reach their highest in the last weeks of pregnancy, and as this increases, it
 triggers the formation of <B>oxytocin receptors</B> in the uterus.  Late in pregnancy, fetal cells produce increasing amounts of <B>oxytocin</B>, another hormone, as does the pituitary.  Oxytocin is a powerful smooth muscle stimulant, and due to the receptors which have
 formed in the uterus, causes uterine contractions.  The high estrogen levels also stimulate the placenta to make <B>prostaglandins</B> (similar to those that cause &#147;cramps&#148;) that also stimulate contractions.  The hormonal induction of labor is
 a positive feedback loop.  Oxytocin and the prostaglandins cause uterine contractions that, in turn, stimulate the release of more oxytocin and prostaglandins.  This is partially due to pressure of the baby&#146;s head against the cervix that both dilates the
 cervix and acts on cervical nerve endings to stimulate the production of oxytocin, which causes stronger contractions that cause the baby&#146;s head to be pressed more strongly against the cervix, etc.</P>

<P>There are three stages in the birth process, including:</P>
<OL>  
<LI>the <B>dilation of the cervix</B>, which lasts from the onset of labor until the cervix reaches its full diameter of about 10 cm, and is the longest stage, often lasting 6 to 12 hr or longer,
<LI>the <B>expulsion stage</B>, the time (about 20 min to 1 hr) from full dilation until delivery, during which, strong contractions about 1 min each occur every 2 to 3 min, and the mother feels an increasing urge to push until the baby is forced down,
 into the vagina, and out, and 
<LI>the <B>delivery of the placenta</B> which usually occurs within 15 min of the delivery of the baby.
</OL>        

<P>After the baby is born, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, often before the placenta is delivered.  When the baby is born, much of his/her blood is still circulating in the placenta, and as (s)he begins to breath, that blood is naturally brought
 back into the body, aided by the pulsating of the umbilical cord.  For optimum health of the baby, it is important that as much of the baby&#146;s blood as possible be out of the placenta and into the baby&#146;s body before the cord is cut, thus the person doing
 this should wait until the cord stops pulsating before clamping and cutting it.  Many medical staff people try to rush through this procedure and cut the cord too soon.</P>

<P>After birth, decreasing progesterone and estrogen and increasing oxytocin help reduce the uterus to its normal size.  It has been found that laying the baby on the mother&#146;s abdomen immediately after birth will stimulate the production of oxytocin,
 helping shrink the uterus faster.  The baby&#146;s sucking on the mother&#146;s nipples stimulates nerve endings that also stimulate the production of oxytocin, so immediate
<A HREF="javascript:ShowIt('<B>postpartum</B>:  adjective pertaining to the time just after giving birth to a baby','(<B>post</B> = after, behind; <B>partum</B> = bring forth, bear)','../../sounds/bio105/postpartum.wav')" onMouseOver="window.status='Having just given birth'; return true"><B>postpartum</B></A>
 nursing can also help return uterus to proper size.</P>

<P>The hormones oxytocin and <B>prolactin</B> trigger the production of milk.  While these are present initially in quantities sufficient to begin <B>lactation</B>, the baby&#146;s sucking triggers further release of these hormones, in yet another
 positive feedback loop.  At first, <B>colostrum</B> is produced.  This nutrient-rich substance contains lots of antibodies, etc. important to the baby&#146;s health for the first few days and it&#146;s very important that the baby have the benefit of this
 nutrition.  Also, nursing is important in the bonding process, and for that reason, too, it&#146;s very important to let a baby nurse immediately after birth.  There is evidence that human babies imprint on the smell of their mothers&#146; nipples.  Instinctively, when a newborn is first trying to nurse, (s)he will turn his/her mouth toward
 anything that brushes his/her cheek.  Frequently, in hospital setting, well-meaning nurses trying to &#147;help&#148; can actually distract and confuse the baby by touching the baby&#146;s face, thus making it harder for the baby to find the nipple.  In
 contrast, brushing the baby&#146;s cheek with the nipple will cause the baby to turn toward it.  About 2 to 3 days after the birth, the mother&#146;s real milk will begin to be produced.  This is a specially-designed food source that exactly matches the
 nutritional needs of a baby, thus every effort should be made to make use of mother&#146;s milk rather than artificial substitutes which often are nutritionally lacking.</P>

<P>For couples who are trying to avoid creating a baby, a number of birth control methods that prevent fertilization (<B>contraceptives</B>) are available, but not all methods of birth control fit into that category.
 In one method of &#147;natural&#148; birth control, the woman must have very regular, predictable cycles and must keep a very accurate, daily record of her body temperature (first thing in the morning before getting out of bed) and condition of her cervical mucus in order to determine when ovulation is occurring.
 The couple must, then, cooperate in being willing to forego a few minutes of pleasure within several days of ovulation, in the interest of building a strong, long-term, loving relationship.
 Since many women&#146;s cycles are not that predictable and/or many women do not wish to keep such detailed records and/or many couples would rather not have to consult a calendar, a variety of other methods of preventing ovulation or preventing sperm from reaching the egg are available.
 Some of the hormone pills prevent ovulation, and many of the barrier methods attempt to prevent sperm from getting up into the uterus, either by introducing a physical barrier between the penis and the uterus (cervical cap, diaphragm, condom) or by killing the sperm (spermicidal chemicals inserted into the vagina).
 However, none of these methods is a substitute for willpower and personal responsibility, and will not prevent conception if the people involved do not choose to discipline themselves to &#147;make it work.&#148;  If a barrier or foam is neglected or used improperly or if a woman doesn't take the pills on schedule, a baby is a likely outcome.
 Birth control methods that permanently make reproduction impossible are called <B>sterilization</B>, and include things like vasectomy, tubal ligation, and hysterectomy.</P>

<P>As mentioned above, some birth control methods like IUDs and some drugs prevent an already-fertilized and growing embryo from implanting in the uterus, thus are <B>abortifacients</B>, agents that cause abortions.
 RU-486 is specifically meant to kill an unborn baby, and must be taken in conjunction with other drugs that cause uterine contractions to expel the dead baby.  According to patient literature which some of my female students received along with Depo-Provera injections,
 this drug works by thinning the endometrium of the woman�s uterus
 so that when/if a week-old blastocyst-stage embryo reaches her uterus, it will have no place to implant, and will, thus, die.
 While some people feel that abortion should legally be available
 as a means of correcting &#147;mistakes,&#148; it is not a contraceptive and should not be routinely used as such.  Legal or not, abortion is not a substitute for personal willpower and responsibility for one&#146;s own actions.
 In early abortions, a suction device is used to dismember and remove the baby.  In mid-term abortions, special tongs are used to dismember the baby
 and remove the pieces.  In late-term abortions, some of the amniotic fluid is replaced with a strong salt solution to try to burn/poison/kill the baby, and the woman is then given drugs to induce labor.
 In late-term, &#147;partial birth&#148; abortions, the baby is manipulated into the breech birth position, then labor is induced.  At the end of the delivery, the baby�s head is held inside the mother&#146;s vagina (so the birth isn&#146;t &#147;official&#148;)
 while a suction device is inserted at the top of the baby&#146;s spine to remove his/her brain.  When the baby is dead, the head is allowed to be born.
 Numerous studies have shown that women who go through these procedures often suffer from depression, sometimes severe, as a result.  Studies have even found that years later, often without consciously realizing the cause, many of these women suffer
 depression especially on the anniversary of the date they had the abortion and/or on what would have been their child�s birthday.
 If you would like to see what actually goes on in an abortion, get hold of a copy of the movie &#147;Eclipse of Reason.&#148;</P>

<P>The only totally effective method of preventing making a baby (short of sterilization) is abstinence, yet in our culture, we&#146;re bringing up a whole generation of young people who are being taught
 that they couldn&#146;t possibly be expected to have the personal willpower and responsibility for their actions to make that work.  In previous generations when young people were taught that they were capable of abstinance and were expected to abstain from sexual intercourse until marriage, the rates of teen-age pregnancies among unwed mothers were much lower.</P>

<P>A number of <B>sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)</B> are caught/spread by having sexual intercourse with multiple partners, thus are easily avoided if a person so chooses.  Some of these diseases are caused by viruses, while others are bacterial in origin.
 For example, �genital warts,� or human papiloma virus (HPV) is spread by sexual contact or by lying, naked, on an unsterilized tanning bed.  HPV has been associated with cervical cancer in women, often necessitating a hysterectomy, perhaps at a young-enough age to preclude any opportunity of having children.</P>

<P>One interesting aspect of this is that while our government has been telling people that use of condoms will
 prevent STDs, current research indicates that&#146;s not entirely true.  The latex of which condoms are made, just like any chemical, has pores or holes in between the molecules of which it is made.  These holes are small enough that relatively large sperm cells are
 larger than the holes, so usually don&#146;t get through.  However, viruses like the AIDS virus are several powers of 10 smaller in size than a &#147;large&#148; sperm cell, and are smaller than the size of the holes in the latex, thus can go through them and
 infect someone!  Since the holes in the latex are not exactly lined up and it&#146;s not a &#147;straight shot&#148; going through them, that does somewhat lessen the chance that an AIDS (or other) virus can find its way through.  Thus, while use of condoms may <I>reduce</I> the chances of
 getting AIDS or some other virus, they do not <I>prevent</I> these diseases.</P>

<P>Other than unusual cases like hemophiliacs who need blood transfusions, the vast majority of people can control their chances of contracting AIDS if they choose to do so.  Your chances of being exposed to AIDS are directly dependent on
 your lifestyle.  If you choose to have sexual intercourse with many partners and have no idea with whom else they&#146;ve had intercourse, it is very likely that you <I>will</I> get AIDS.  If you choose to save sexual intercourse for a special, lifelong
 commitment to one partner who feels the same way, and you&#146;re both the only ones you&#146;ve ever had sex with (and neither of you does IV drugs, etc.), neither of you will be exposed to AIDS.</P>

<P>Also, note that the relatively-thicker walls of a woman�s vagina were designed to take the physical stress of sexual intercourse, while the relatively-thinner walls of a person�s rectum were not.
 Thus, �anal sex� frequently causes tears in the walls of the rectum which, if one�s partner is infected with an STD, can serve as entry sites for that infection.
 The tears from anal sex can significantly damage the rectum, which may necessitate painful, corrective surgery to �fix� accumulated rectal damage.
 If the person�s immune system has been �destroyed� by an HIV infection, the healing process following such surgery can be complicated by increased chances of infection.</P>
