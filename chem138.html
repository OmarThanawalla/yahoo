        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">A highly abridged
        history of the petroleum companies that have used the
        &quot;Standard&quot; brand name.</font></h6>
        <p>John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust is one of the
        most famous industrial organizations ever. The Trust
        controlled a lion's share of the production, transport,
        refining, and marketing of petroleum products in the
        United States and many other countries. Originally, this
        Trust was an attempt to cash in on the lucrative home
        lighting market which was converting from whale oil to
        kerosene. The emergence of the automobile and its thirst
        for the formerly near worthless refining by-product
        called gasoline brought dizzying wealth to this
        industrial group. The 1911 decision to break up the Trust
        had the result of making the seperate pieces more
        valubale than the whole was, and stock prices rose
        sharply. When he was informed of the US Supreme Court's
        descision to breakup of Standard Oil, Mr. Rockefeller
        turned to his golfing partner and said, &quot;Father
        Lennon, have you some money?&quot; And the priest was
        very startled by the question and said, &quot;No.&quot;
        And then he said, &quot;Why?&quot; And Rockefeller
        replied, &quot;Buy Standard Oil.&quot; <font size="1">(</font><a
        href="#titan"><font size="1">1</font></a><font size="1">)</font>
        The break up of Standard Oil mirrors a more modern
        monopoly breakup - AT&amp;T - a.k.a. The Bell System,
        &quot;Ma Bell&quot;. Both developed ubiquitous brand
        names: <b><i>Bell</i></b> for telephone service, <b><i>Standard</i></b>
        for oil. Like the &quot;Baby Bells&quot;, many of the
        &quot;Baby Standards&quot; kept the old company identity
        as they went into business for themselves. Unlike the
        various Bell companies, they were restricted from using
        Standard name in each other's territory. They defended
        the exclusive territorial rights to the name vigorously.
        Both fractured entities rose again to dominate the market
        and became more valuable than the original parent. More
        Standard Oil Companies were created as some successor
        organizations declined to use the venerable Standard name
        in favor of pre-trust identities and the other Standards
        expanded into those marketing areas. As national
        advertising and travel blossomed, the various Standards
        ended up in competition, often adopting the names of
        smaller oil companies they had purchased. The goal of
        this site is to track the history of the Baby Standards,
        discovering what became of Rockefeller's petroleum
        powerhouse. </p>

        a secondary manner on some of thier remaining pay phones.
        No word on <a href="http://www.qwest.com/">Qwest</a>,
        though they have a swoop logo in advertising and I can't
        recall ever seeing them use the Bell. The new <a
        href="http://att.sbc.com/">at&amp;t</a> is led by SBC
        (Southwestern Bell) after having absorbed Pacific
        Telesis, then purchasing the remains of AT&amp;T.
        BellSouth was also absorbed by SBC. BellSouth made
        extensive use of the old Bell logo before the merger. Now
        they use the at&amp;t &quot;Death Marble&quot; adaptation
        of the AT&amp;T &quot;Death Star&quot; logo. <a
        href="http://www.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>'s Bell logo is
        red or white on a red background. <a
        href="http://www.cincinnatibell.com/">Cincinnati Bell</a>
        quit using the classic bell in 2005. If the Bell company
        consolidation was the pattern for Standard Oil Company
        consolidation - Sohio (Cincinnati Bell) would still be
        independent, ExxonMobil would be Verizon (Exxon =
        BellAtlantic + Mobil = Nynex) and Chevron (SBC / Pacific
        Telesys) would have purchased Amoco (Ameritech), then
        finally turned and purchased KYSO (BellSouth). If the
        Bell reconsolidation had mirrored Standard Oil's: SBC/
        Pac Tel would have bought BellSouth early on. British
        Telecom would have bought Sohio. BellAtlantic and Nynex
        would have merged. Lastly, British Telecom would have
        merged with Ameritech, told everyone they were changing
        thier name to Ameritech for US operations, then changed
        thier minds and used &quot;bt&quot; - Beyond
        Telecommunications.</td>

Company of Colorado and sold stock by 1930 to small investors
trying to get a piece of the fractured Trust as the demand for
gasoline increased. The company had no oil wells, no refineries,
and no gasoline stations. In 1930, Indiana Standard was extending
its &quot;Standard&quot; marketing area into Conoco territory -
Colorado and other Rocky Mountain states. After much confusion,
in 1931 Indiana Standard sued Colorado Standard over the use of
the Standard Oil name and won. In 1934, the suit was upheld and
Colorado Standard was relegated to the footnotes of history.</font></p>
