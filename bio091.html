		<td width="325" valign="top" background="IMesh-imesh-5.html" class="article">The <STRONG>Bone Wars</STRONG> were an 
		infamous period in the history of   paleontology when the two pre-eminent paleontologists of the time, Edward   Drinker Cope and Othniel 
		Charles Marsh, were competing to see who could find the most, and most 
		sensational, new species of dinosaur. This competition was marred by 
		bribery, politics, violations of American Indian territories, and 
		virulent personal attacks.  Every once in awhile a dig turns up stones that are dimonds.  
		This is a financial win for all and the money earned is usually thrown back into the researchers dig.
		  <p>By most standards, Marsh won the Bone Wars. 
		Both made finds of incredible scientific value, but while Marsh 
		discovered a total of 86 new species, due in part to his discovery of 
		the Como Bluff site, near Medicine Bow, Wyoming (one of the richest 
		source of fossils known), Cope only discovered 56. Many of the fossils 
		Cope unearthed were of species that had already been named, or were of 
		uncertain origin. And while the species Marsh discovered include 
		household names, like the Triceratops, Allosaurus, Diplodocus, and 
		Stegosaurus, even Cope's most famous discoveries, like the Dimetrodon, 
		Camarasaurus, Coelophysis, and Monoclonius were more obscure. But their 
		cumulative finds defined the field of paleontology; at the start of the 
		Bone Wars, there were only nine named species of dinosaur in North 
		America; and some of their theories � like Marsh's argument that birds 
		are descended from dinosaurs; or &quot;Cope's law&quot;, which states that over 
		time species tend to get larger � are still referred to today.<br>
		<br>
		Cope is widely regard as the more brilliant scientist, but more brash 
		and careless. He was so prolific, publishing more than 1,200 scientific 
		papers, that he set a record he still holds to this day. Marsh in turn 
		was colder, more methodical; but the better politician � he moved easily 
		among the members of high society, including President Ulysses S. Grant 
		and the Rothschilds. He even befriended Buffalo Bill Cody and the Lakota 
		Indian chief Red Cloud.<br>
		<br>
		Their rivalry lasted until Cope's death in 1897, but before the end, 
		they both ran out of money. Marsh got Cope's federal funding cut off 
		(including his funding from the U.S. Geological Survey), and Cope had to 
		sell part of his collection. Marsh in turn had to mortgage his home, and 
		ask Yale for a salary to live on.</td>

		<td width="325" valign="top" class="article"><b>Tyrannosaurus Rex</b> (ty-RAN-o-sawr-us) 
		meaning &quot;tyrant lizard&quot; because of its size and large teeth and claws 
		(Greek tyrannos = tyrant + sauros = lizard), also known colloquially as 
		T. rex and The King of the Dinosaurs, was a giant carnivorous theropod 
		dinosaur from the Upper Maastrichtian, the last stage of the Cretaceous 
		period, 65�66 million years ago. 
		<p>Its fossil remains are relatively rare; as of 2005 only 30 specimens 
		had been found, including three complete skulls. The first specimens 
		found played an important role in the Bone Wars. T. rex is the best 
		known carnivorous dinosaur, particularly because it was regarded as the 
		largest to have ever existed for a long time. While evidence indicates 
		that Giganotosaurus was probably larger, T. rex will very likely remain 
		a subject of ongoing scientific research and popular culture.</p>
		<p>Over 12 m (40 feet) in length, 6 m (20.4 feet) tall and 4 tonnes in 
		weight, T. rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time. 
		Compared to other carnivorous dinosaurs, the skull of Tyrannosaurus is 
		heavily modified. Many of the bones are fused together, preventing 
		movement between them. The bones themselves are much more massive than 
		is typical of a theropod, and the serrated teeth, far from being 
		bladelike, are massive and oval in cross-section. Heavy wear and the 
		bite marks found on bones of other dinosaurs indicate that these teeth 
		could bite into solid bone. The teeth are often worn or broken at the 
		tips from heavy use but, unlike mammals, were continually grown and shed 
		throughout the life of the animal. Compared to other giant carnivorous 
		dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, Tyrannosaurus appears to have had a 
		sizeable brain, but was probably not particularly intelligent by 
		mammalian standards.<br>
		<br>
		The neck was short and musclular, to support the head. The 
		arms of T. rex were very small, perhaps to make up for the weight of its 
		enormous head, but were very sturdy. They may have been used for 
		grasping during mating or as aids in standing. The legs were relatively 
		long and slender for an animal of its size. To compensate for its 
		immense bulk, the interior of many bones were hollow. This considerably 
		reduced the weight of the skeleton while maintaining much of the 
		strength of the bones.<p>North America and China/Central Asia in the 
		times of the tyrannosauids had both familiar and strange elements. The 
		soft-shelled turtles, crocodiles, pike (Esocidae), and gar (Lepisosteidae) 
		alive at the time are quite similar to those living today. Frogs and 
		monitor lizards were other familiar animals. Ferns, palms, and shrubs 
		were some of the dominant plants; grasses had evolved but were possibly 
		not yet widespread. Conifers such as sequoias were common. 
		<p>The North American T. rex probably lived in many different habitats 
		because of its broad range, but many of the fossil sites in which it is 
		commonly found appear to have been humid subtropical forests. Birds with 
		beaks were already around, including waterfowl. Other inhabitants of the 
		landscape are more unfamiliar. There were birds with teeth, and birds 
		had by then replaced most of the pterosaurs. Some giant pterosaurs still 
		thrived, like Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus, which had an estimated 
		wingspan up to 12 m, possibly 18 m. 
		<p>Herds of Triceratops and duck-billed dinosaurs (hadrosaurs) roamed 
		the land. Mammals (predominantly multituberculates and marsupials) were 
		mostly small, shrew- to rat-sized nocturnal animals. There were some 
		mammals up to the size of a medium modern dog, as shown by recent 
		fossils in China. Such mammals presumably lived in swamps or very heavy 
		vegetation for cover as they could not run fast. Primitive primates may 
		have been around (this issue is open to debate). Snakes had evolved by 
		this time, very similar to some snakes today.

		<td width="325" valign="top" class="article"><b>Prehistoric life</b> is 
		a term used to refer to diverse organisms that inhabited Earth from the 
		origin of life about 3.5 billion years ago to the time when humans began 
		to keep written records, about 3500 BC. During the course of evolution, 
		new forms of life developed and many other forms, such as the dinosaurs, 
		became extinct. 
		<p>Prehistoric life evolved over this vast timespan from simple 
		bacteria-like cells in the oceans to algae and protozoans and complex 
		multicellular forms such as worms, molluscs, crustaceans, fish, insects, 
		land plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. On a geological 
		timescale humans evolved very recently, about 4 million years ago at the 
		earliest, although the exact dating is a matter of some debate. </p>
		<p>A few forms of prehistoric life like some plants and notable animals 
		such as the coelacanth are ancient life forms and still exist today, 
		making them living fossils. Others, like sharks, have changed little 
		over eons. For most forms of prehistorical life that became extinct, the 
		only record of them ever existing that remain today are fossils or rock 
		imprints.<br>

	  <p style="padding-left: 20px;" valign="top">In film, the horror genre is 
		characterized by the attempt to make the viewer experience dread, fear, 
		terror, disgust or horror. Its plots often involve the intrusion of an 
		evil force, event, or personage, sometimes of supernatural origin, into 
		the mundane world.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 20px;" valign="top">	Some of the most common elements include vampires, zombies (and other 
		forms of resurrected corpses), werewolves, ancient curses, ghosts, 
		demons and/or demonic possession, Satanism, evil children, 'slasher 
		villains', vicious animals, inanimate objects brought to life by black 
		magic or twisted science, haunted houses, cannibals, and malicious 
		extraterrestrials. The serial killer movie is sometimes regarded as part 
		of the horror genre.</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 20px;" valign="top">	Specific stories and characters, often derived from classic literature, 
		have also proven popular, and have inspired many sequels, remakes, and 
		copycats. These include Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man 
		and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.</p>

		<p style="padding-left: 20px;" valign="top">Its best-known comics

		<p style="padding-left: 20px;" valign="top">Marvel Comics was founded by established pulp magazine publisher Martin 
		Goodman in 1939 as an eventual group of subsidiary companies under the 
		umbrella name Timely Comics. Its first publication was Marvel Comics #1 
		(Oct. 1939), featuring the first appearance of Carl Burgos' android 
		superhero, the Human Torch, and the first generally available appearance 
		of Bill Everett's mutant anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner. The contents 
		of that sales blockbuster were supplied by an outside packager, Funnies, 
		Inc., but by the following year Timely had a staff in place.</p>
