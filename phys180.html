      <h1>Relativistic Starflight</h1>

      <p>What would it be like to travel in a <em>real</em> starship?
      It's weirder than <i>Star Trek</i>, but not nearly as fast-paced.
      <i>xrel</i> depicts, as realistically as possible, the
      appearance of stars as seen from a starship moving at speeds close
      to the speed of light.  The results are surprising, maybe even
      counterintuitive, but physically accurate to the limits of my
      knowledge.</p>

      <p>Example: Traveling through the Lattice Cluster at 0.5 c</p>

      <p>You can run <i>xrel</i> yourself, if you have <a
      href="takes.html">what it takes</a> -- it should run on most UNIX
      systems with the standard math library and X window system
      libraries and display on any X terminal or workstation X display.
      Just get the <a href="xrel.c">source code</a>, and read about how
      to <a href="build.html">build it</a> and <a href=run.html>run
      it</a> on your system.</p>

      <h2>Sample images</h2>
      <p>Each image is a 640x480 GIF, but don't worry -- most images are
      fairly small files that won't take long to download (the largest
      is about 12K and most are around 5K).  You can pick images from
      their descriptions below, or view <a href="samples.html">a page
      where they're all inlined</a>.</p>

      <p>These images were generated with <samp>xrel -seed 19660410 -times
      0 -size 2</samp> at the indicated velocity, and show the same
      random starfield.</p>

      <h2>This is too weird!  What's going on?</h2>

      <p>Coming soon: about the physics behind <i>xrel</i>, and how
      <i>xrel</i> works (including the cheesy
      approximations).</p>

      <p>As a start, here's a brief <a href="astro.html">explanation</a>
      of how the apparent brightness of stars is measured and why
      they have the colors they do.</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>Similar projects by other people</h2>

      <p>These people have also done relativistic visualization work,
      with varying focuses and levels of realism.</p>

      <p>Wade Lutgen &lt;wade@pacific.mps.ohio-state.edu&gt; has
      what is probably the most similar program to mine, his own
      <a href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wade/relativity.html">
      Relativistic Flight Simulator</a> which is available both
      in MS-DOS/MS-Windows and UNIX/X versions.  Despite the
      similarity in intent, his simulator is very different in
      implementation.  Among the differences are that his stars
      appear to be monochromatic sources and he allows you to
      turn your ship incrementally.  On the down side his
      simulator seems to be a lot slower than mine on the same
      hardware, requires either a lot of free colors or a
      TrueColor display in X, and core dumps whenever I quit from
      it.  All in all, it's an interesting comparison in
      approaches to the same problem.
      </p>

      <p>David Porterhouse &lt;anima@compuserve.com&gt; has a
      <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/anima/rfslink.htm">
      Relativistic Flight Simulation</a> page with links to other
      simulation projects, including his own.  Here you can also find
      links to MS-DOS/MS-Windows-based simulation software and
      downloadable movies/animations.</p>

      <p>Antony Searle &lt;acsearle@ozemail.com.au&gt; has
      written an excellent relativistic raytracer called <a
      href="http://www.anu.edu.au/Physics/Searle/">Backlight</a>
      that accurately depicts several relativistic effects.  Of
      particular interest is that Backlight was written from the
      beginning to handle relativistic effects like the finite
      speed of light and frame computations, rather than as
      modifications to an existing raytracer to introduce
      relativistic corrections to traditional raytracer
      assumptions (such as an infinite speed of light and
      absolute space/time coordinates).  He distributes the
      source code, so you can play with it yourself.  His web
      page includes sample images and animations, and you can
      order videotapes of animations made with his software.</p>

      <p>Andrew Howard &lt;andrbh@cs.mu.OZ.AU&gt; developed
      extensions to the POVray raytracer to depict most relativistic
      optical effects (except for doppler shifting) and has some nice
      images and movies demonstrating them.  His <a
      href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~andrbh/raytrace/raytrace.html">
      Relativistic Ray-Tracing</a> page includes a good technical paper
      on relativistic optical effects.</p>

      <p>John Walker &lt;kelvin@fourmilab.ch&gt; also
      attempted to modify POVray to depict relativistic effects,
      although with less accuracy than Andrew Howard's project.  His <a
      href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/cship/cship.html">C-ship</a> pages
      include movies and his explanations of relativistic optical
      effects, and while he does attempt to simulate the color effects
      of doppler shifting he does not successfully depict the effects of
      the finite speed of light.  Nevertheless, his depictions are
      interesting to compare to the other simulations.</p>

      <p>Robert Nemiroff created the excellent <a
      href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html">Virtual
      Trips to Black Holes and Neutron Stars Page</a>, which depicts
      general relativistic effects, as opposed to the special
      relativistic effects shown by <i>xrel</i>.  He is also one of
      the maintainers of one of my favorite web sites, <a
      href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">Astronomy
      Picture of the Day</a>.</p>
