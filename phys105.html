<menu compact align=justify><li align=justify><i>CMIS Oversight:</i>
 Reviewed and monitored progress on Boeing antenna and receiver subsystems, and performance of ocean Environmental Data Record 
(EDR, i.e. retrieved geophysical parameter) algorithms.  Worked with Antenna Systems Department to develop alternate expressions 
for fully polarimetric antenna cross-polarization matrix (Mueller Matrix or "M-matrix") that gave a more intuitive framework for 
computing the M-matrix from far-field antenna patterns and highlighted geometric factors.  Gave day-long tutorial to Boeing 
engineering staff on computation of M-matrix, and transformations necessary to put M-matrix in the form needed for 
cross-polarization correction in Sensor Data Record (SDR) algorithm.  Developed software for computation of M-matrix 
from antenna range measurements in the two most common far-field conventions; coupled with simulated CMIS antenna 
patterns to perform sensitivity analyses of M-matrix error to nadir angle variation, and pattern extent and angular resolution. 
</li></menu>
<br>
<menu compact align=justify><li align=justify><i>Discovery of Shadowing Effect:</i> 
 Built upon M-matrix code to develop brightness temperature measurement simulation of scanning an offset parabolic reflector 
antenna over earth scenes; discovered spurious signals in third and fourth Stokes parameter measurements over rain cell, 
cloud, and coastal boundaries (<A HREF="http://www.igarss08.org/Abstracts/pdfs/3896.pdf">"Shadowing Effect"</A>) that 
can degrade wind vector retrieval.  Identified the different mechanisms that result third and fourth Stokes shadowing, 
and estimated size of spurious signals for various earth scenes; compared with WindSat data to validate theory.  
Determined both hardware mitigation and SDR algorithm correction methods for fourth Stokes shadowing; showed that 
third Stokes shadowing effect cannot be easily mitigated or corrected.  Developed briefings for CMIS sensor and 
algorithm contractors and conference papers on shadowing effect and mitigation/correction methods.

Worked with <A HREF="http://www.tecolote.com/">Tecolote Corporation</A> on cost estimation for 7 MIS options 
differing in reflector size and channelization (review, debug, and refine cost estimation process, assist in 
development of cost briefing). Roughly estimated EDR performance for each option with NPOESS program office

MIS Conceptual Model and Conceptual (Point) Design</A></i>: 
Co-developed, with Antenna Systems Department, an MIS Conceptual Model consisting of: (1) a complete <A HREF="http://www.ticra.com/products/software/grasp">GRASP</A> 
electromagnetic model of the MIS antenna (based on modification of WindSat antenna to accommodate sounding channel 
feeds and maximize forward swath) and local NPOESS bus geometry; (2) code to transform GRASP results into scan 
geometry (footprint sizes, scan arc radii, measurement swath width)�and compute integration times based on WindSat 
oversampling rates�as a function of antenna boresight nadir angle; and (3) code to compute radiometer noise (NEDTs) 
from integration times, bandpasses, and noise figures for receiver mock-ups we developed.  Optimized feed placement 
to maximize swath width without degrading radiometric performance and spatial resolution. Leveraged resources of MIS 
Performance Team ("MPT" from U. Colorado, <A HREF="http://aoss.engin.umich.edu/people/cruf">U. Mich.</A>, 
<A HREF="http://nsstc.uah.edu/essc/">U. of A. Huntsville</A>,

resampling for computation of EDR swath width and noise reduction factors (NRFs) given scan geometry and retrieval 
cell sizes, and (2) determine ocean EDR performance from NEDTs and NRFs.  Used Conceptual Model to finalize MIS 
Conceptual Design: utilizing all resources above, conducted an iterative trade on boresight nadir angle to meet 
legacy EDR swath width requirements for ocean wind and sounding EDRs, while exceeding legacy accuracy and cell 
size requirements for legacy EDRs, and providing acceptable performance for other EDRs. <p>
</li></menu>

<menu compact align=justify><li align=justify><i>MIS Requirements Development </i>: 
Used MIS Conceptual Design results to define channel bandpass, footprint size, measurement swath width, 
sampling interval, and NEDT requirements for MIS System and Sensor Specifications, and to revise EDR swath 
width and accuracy requirements for non-legacy EDRs in the Algorithm and System Specifications. Based on 
previous work on CMIS and requirements for WindSat, developed MIS requirements for antenna cross-polarization, 
polarization rotation angle (PRA), and Earth incidence angle (EIA) control and knowledge errors for System 
and Sensor Specifications. Derived requirements for sensor roll/pitch/yaw knowledge error from PRA/EIA 
knowledge error and mapping uncertainty requirements.  Authored significant sections of System, Sensor, 
and Algorithm Specifications. Performed quarterly side-by-side reviews of all MIS Specification Documents 
and developed "issues lists" for iterative adjudication with program office personnel. Reviewer on selection 
team for MIS Sensor Contractor.

requirements additions with sensor contractor, providing specific rationale based on EDR and resampling 
algorithm needs. Reviewer on selection team for MIS Operational Algorithm Development Team (ADT).

<menu compact align=justify><li align=justify><i>Radiometric Implications of Polarization Rotation Angle Knowledge Error: </i>
At the request of JPSS program office, determined 88 and 183 GHz brightness temperature measurement error 
resulting from polarization rotation angle (PRA) knowledge error of 88 and 183 GHz polarization grids. 
Developed rudimentary no-cloud over-ocean brightness temperature (TB) model function for 88.2 and 
183.31 +/- 7 GHz channels as a function of sea surface temperature and columnar water vapor. For 
columnar water vapor levels spanning sub-arctic to tropical oceans, computed TBs with and without 
PRA error for each scan position. Produced summary of findings, indicating significant TB error 
over last 40% of scan (sufficient to exceed TB accuracy error requirement) for all but tropical 
scenes. Resulted in direction from JPSS program office to sensor contractor to improve antenna 
range and antenna testing procedure.  Along-scan TB error signature at 88.2 GHz indicated that 
existing PRA error in on-orbit NPP ATMS could be identified and quantified using long-term scan 
position by scan position averages of highly filtered over-ocean TBs. 
</li></menu>

<menu compact align=justify><li align=justify><i>Identification and Quantification of ATMS Sensor Errors Through On-Orbit Along-Scan TB Error Signatures: </i>
Developed additional sensor error models for antenna cross-polarization, sensor roll and pitch, 
scan drive error, and receiver non-linearity, and coupled with 88.2 GHz TB simulator to determine 
along-scan TB error signatures of each of these sensor errors.  Found that each signature is 
sufficiently distinct to be able to identify and perhaps quantify the major contributors to 
on-orbit TB error for NPP ATMS. Obtained funding from JPSS program office, and directed effort 
to derive total TB error along-scan signature for NPP ATMS: development of software for matchups 
between ATMS TBs and NCEP FNL ocean and atmospheric parameters; filtering for no-cloud, over-ocean, 
low wind speed scenes in incremental water vapor bins; scan position by scan position averaging of 
several months of TBs in each bin, and subtraction of TBs simulated from matchup data).
