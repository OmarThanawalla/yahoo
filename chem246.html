One of the neurotransmitters playing a major role in addiction is 
<STRONG>dopamine</STRONG>. Many of the concepts that apply to dopamine apply to 
other neurotransmitters as well.
<P>
As a chemical messenger, dopamine is similar to adrenaline. Dopamine affects brain 
processes that control movement, emotional response, and ability to experience pleasure 
and pain.

Regulation of dopamine plays a crucial role in our mental and physical health.  Neurons 
containing the neurotransmitter dopamine are clustered in the midbrain in an area called the 
<STRONG>substantia nigra </STRONG>.  In Parkinson's disease, the dopamine-
transmitting neurons in this area die. As a result, the brains of people with Parkinson's 
disease contain almost no dopamine. To help relieve their symptoms, we give these people 
L-DOPA, a drug that can be converted in the brain to dopamine.

Some drugs are known as dopamine <STRONG>agonists.</STRONG> These drugs bind 
to dopamine receptors in place of dopamine and directly stimulate those receptors. Some 
dopamine agonists are currently used to treat Parkinson's disease. These drugs can 
stimulate dopamine receptors even in someone without dopamine neurons.

<P>
In contrast to dopamine agonists, dopamine  <STRONG>antagonists </STRONG> are 
drugs that bind but don't stimulate dopamine receptors. Antagonists can prevent or reverse 
the actions of dopamine by keeping dopamine from attaching to receptors.

Dopamine antagonists are traditionally used to treat schizophrenia and related mental 
disorders. A person with schizophrenia may have an overactive dopamine system. 
Dopamine antagonists can help regulate this system by &#34turning down&#34 dopamine 
activity.
<P>
Cocaine and other drugs of abuse can alter dopamine function. Such drugs may have very 
different actions. The specific action depends on which dopamine receptors the drugs 
stimulate or block, and how well they mimic dopamine.

Drugs can act directly or indirectly on dopamine receptors </H3>
<P>
Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine produce their effects by changing the flow of 
neurotransmitters. These drugs are defined as <STRONG>indirect</STRONG> acting 
because they depend on the activity of neurons. In contrast, some drugs bypass 
neurotransmitters altogether and act directly on receptors. Such drugs are 
<STRONG>direct</STRONG> acting.  
<P>
Use of these two types of drugs can lead to very different results in treating the same 
disease. As mentioned earlier, people with Parkinson's disease lose neurons that contain 
dopamine. To compensate for this loss, the body produces more dopamine receptors on 
other neurons. Indirect agonists are not very effective in treating the disease since they 
depend on the presence of dopamine neurons. In contrast, direct agonists are more effective 
because they stimulate dopamine receptors even when dopamine neurons are missing.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>
MAO affects dopamine levels </H3>
<P>
Once returned to the sending neuron by the reuptake system, dopamine is subject to an 
enzyme named <STRONG>monoamine oxidase (MAO)</STRONG>.  MAO usually 
breaks down dopamine. 
<P>
If no other factors were at work, MAO would keep the amount of &#34used&#34 
dopamine fairly low. However, dopamine taken back into the nerve ending can return to 
the vesicle for storage. Once inside the vesicle, dopamine is protected from MAO. 
<P>
A drug named reserpine prevents the reuptake of dopamine and some other 
neurotransmitters. Administering reserpine causes dopamine to remain exposed within the 
cell and broken down by MAO. This profoundly reduces the available dopamine. 
<P>
Changing the action of MAO can help us treat diseases that involve dopamine transmission. 
For instance, the drug deprenyl inhibits MAO. This increases the stores of dopamine and 
slows the progression of Parkinson's disease. In higher doses, deprenyl enhances the 
effects of dopamine on behavior.
<P>
  Interestingly, one form of MAO actually protects dopamine. This form of MAO, found in 
dopamine neurons, acts on substances in the neuron other than dopamine. Here MAO 
protects the &#34purity&#34 of neurotransmission by breaking down other 
neurotransmitters. Inhibiting this form of MAO can increase levels of neurotransmitters 
such as serotonin, which seems to help people diagnosed with depression. 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN-LEFT>
Drugs can also affect dopamine levels</H3>
<P>
Dopamine binds to its receptors quickly. This neurotransmitter is also quickly removed 
from its receptors as long as dopamine levels in the synapse are sufficiently high. 
<P>
However, drugs can affect dopamine levels. Some drugs increase dopamine by preventing 
dopamine reuptake, leaving more dopamine in the synapse. An example is the widely 
abused stimulant drug, cocaine. Another is methylphenidate, used therapeutically to treat 
childhood hyperkinesis and symptoms of schizophrenia. 
<P> 
It's interesting that amphetamine and cocaine produce affect behavior and heart function in 
similar ways. Furthermore, both drugs increase the amount of dopamine in the synapse. 
However, cocaine achieves this action by preventing dopamine reuptake, while 
amphetamine helps to release more dopamine. So, these drugs with similar effects produce 
their actions through entirely different processes. In turn, addiction to the two drugs may 
call for somewhat different types of treatment.

Neurons can become sensitized or desensitized to dopamine</H3>
<P>
One important aspect of drug addiction is how cells adapt to previous drug exposure.  
<P>
For example, long-term treatment with dopamine antagonists increases the number of 
dopamine receptors. This happens as the nervous system tries to make up for less 
stimulation of the receptors by dopamine itself. Likewise, the receptors themselves become 
more sensitive to dopamine. Both are examples of the same process, called 
<STRONG>sensitization.</STRONG></TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
<P>
An opposite effect occurs after dopamine or dopamine agonists repeatedly stimulate 
dopamine receptors. Here overstimulation decreases the number of receptors, and the 
remaining receptors become less sensitive to dopamine. This process is called 
<STRONG>desensitization. </STRONG>
<P>

<IMG SRC="desensitisation.gif" HEIGHT=160 WIDTH=197 alt=" A type of desensitization"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="5%"><BR></TD>
<TD  ROWSPAN=2 ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=BOTTOM>
Desensitization is better known as <STRONG>tolerance,</STRONG> where exposure to 
a drug causes less  response than previously caused. Tolerance reflects the actions of the 
nervous system to maintain <STRONG>homeostasis </STRONG>-a constant degree of 
cell activity in spite of major changes in receptor stimulation. The nervous system maintains 
this constant level in an attempt to keep the body in a state of equilibrium, even when 
foreign chemicals are present.
<P>
Sensitization and desensitization do not take place only after long-term understimulation or 
overstimulation of dopamine receptors. Both sensitization and desensitization can occur 
after only a single exposure to a drug. In fact, they may develop within a few minutes.

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>
Disease and drugs can produce faulty sensitization</H3>
<P>
Sensitization or desensitization normally occur with drug exposure. However, addiction or 
mental illness can tamper with the reuptake system. This disrupts the normal levels of 
neurotransmitters in the brain and can lead to faulty desensitization or sensitization. If this 
happens in a region of the brain that serves emotion or motivation, the individual can suffer 
severe consequences.
<P>
Consider an example. Cocaine prevents dopamine reuptake by binding to proteins that 
normally transport dopamine. Not only does cocaine &#34bully&#34 dopamine out of the 
way-it hangs on to the transport proteins much longer than dopamine does. As a result, 
more dopamine remains to stimulate neurons, which causes a prolonged feelings of 
pleasure and excitement. Amphetamine also increases dopamine levels. Again, the result is 
over-stimulation of these pleasure-pathway nerves in the brain.
