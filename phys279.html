<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</H2> 
	 <P>In March 1993 Charles H. Bennett from IBM proposed a scheme, based on
		Quantum Mechanics, that in principle could be used to teleport an object. The
		scheme was experimentally verified by Dik Bouwmeester et al. in the Fall of
	   1997. In 2004 researchers at the University of Vienna and the Austrian Academy of Science used an 800m-long optical fibre fed through a public sewer system tunnel to connect labs on opposite sides of the River Danube to achieve such teleportation.. </P> 
	 <P>Here we explore this phenomenon of <I>Quantum Teleportation</I>. We will
		then extend the discussion to <I>Quantum Information</I> and <I>Quantum
		Cryptography</I>. The document is based on a discussion with an upper year
		course in modern Physics without mathematics given at the University of
		Toronto. </P> 
	 <P>Although the discussion is almost totally non-mathematical, it requires
		considerable understanding of the Quantum Correlation experiments used in
		describing <I>Bell's Theorem</I>. A document on Bell's Theorem is available
		<A
		 HREF="http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/PVB/Harrison/BellsTheorem/BellsTheorem.html">here</A>;
		total file size including graphics is about 47k.</P> <HR> 
	 <H2 ALIGN="CENTER">TELEPORTATION</H2> 
	 <P>In <I>Star Trek</I>, when Captain Kirk is beamed from the starship
		Enterprise to the surface of a planet, Captain Kirk de-materialises on the
		Enterprise, and then re-materialises on the planet. On the TV show, an
		unanswered question is whether the transporter physically disassembles Captain
		Kirk, moves the atoms from his body to the planet, and then reassembles them.
		Another perhaps more reasonable alternative would be to scan all the
		information about Captain Kirk's physical state, and transmit that information
		to the planet surface where it is used to construct a new Captain Kirk out of
		raw materials found on the planet. Note that in either case the transporter
		needs to have complete information on Kirk's physical state in order to
		reconstruct him.</P> 
	 <P>However, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle means that it is
		impossible to obtain this complete information about Kirk. Thus, it seems that
		the best the transporter can do is make an approximate copy of him on the
		planet surface. Quantum Teleportation provides a way to "beat" the Uncertainty
		Principle and make an exact copy.</P> 
	 <P>As we shall see, the mechanism that beats the Uncertainty Principle is
		the same one used to beat it in the Quantum Correlation experiments we examined
		when we discussed Bell's Theorem. We shall also see that although the collapse
		of the state for the two measurements in the correlation experiments occurs
		instantaneously, the teleportation can not occur faster than the speed of
		light.</P> 
	 <P>Finally, a little terminology. Before we were discussing Quantum
		Correlation experiments in which we were measuring the spins of two separate
		electrons whose total spin was zero. We call the states of those two electrons
		<I>entangled</I>.</P><HR> 
	 <H2 ALIGN="CENTER">BELL-STATE MEASUREMENTS</H2> 
	 <P>In previous discussions we almost always talked about the spin state of
		electrons, although we regularly pointed out that the same situations exist for
		the polarization of light, albeit with a difference of a factor of 2 in the
		angles being used. Here we will reverse the situation, and mostly talk about
		polarization states for photons, although the arguments also apply to spin
		states of electrons.</P> 
	 <P>The fact that we may talk about light polarization in almost the same
		way that we discuss electron spin is not a coincidence. It turns out that
		photons have spins which can exist in only two different states. And those
		different spins states are related to the polarization of the light when we
		think of it as a wave.</P> 
	 <P>Here we shall prepare pairs of entangled photons with opposite
		polarizations; we shall call them <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I> and
		<I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT></I>. The entanglement means that if we
		measure a beam of, say, <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I> photons with a
		polarizer, one-half of the incident photons will pass the filter, regardless of
		the orientation of the polarizer. Whether a particular photon will pass the
		filter is random. However, if we measure its companion <I><FONT
		COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT></I> photon with a polarizer oriented at 90 degrees
		relative to the first, then if <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I> passes
		its filter <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT></I> will also pass its filter.
		Similarly if <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I> does not pass its filter
		its companion <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT></I> will not.</P> 
	 <P>Earlier we discussed the Michelson-Morley experiment, and later the
		Mach-Zehnder interferometer. You will recall that for both of these we had
		half-silvered mirrors, which reflect one-half of the light incident on them and
		transmit the other half without reflection. These mirrors are sometimes called
		<I>beam splitters</I> because they split a light beam into two equal parts.</P>
	 <P>We shall use a half-silvered mirror to perform <I>Bell State
		Measurements</I>. The name is after the originator of Bell's Theorem.</P> 
	 <TABLE WIDTH="100%"> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD> 
			 <P>We direct one of the entangled photons, say <I><FONT
				COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I>, to the beam splitter.</P> 
			 <P>Meanwhile, we prepare another photon with a polarization of
				45<SUP>0</SUP>, and direct it to the same beam splitter from the other side, as
				shown. This is the photon whose properties will be transported; we label it
				<I><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">K</FONT></I> (for Kirk). We time it so that both
				<I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I> and <I><FONT
				COLOR="#FF3300">K</FONT></I> reach the beam splitter at the same time.</P></TD>

		  <TD> 
			 <P>The <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I> photon incident from
				above will be reflected by the beam splitter some of the time and will be
				transmitted some of the time. Similarly for the <I><FONT
				COLOR="#FF3300">K</FONT></I> photon that is incident from below. So sometimes
				both photons will end up going up and to the right as shown.</P> 
			 <P>Similarly, sometimes both photons will end up going <I>down</I>
				and to the right.</P></TD>

		  <TD> 
			 <P>But sometimes one photon will end up going upwards and the other
				will be going downwards, as shown. This will occur when either both photons
				have been reflected or both photons have been transmitted.</P> 
			 <P>Thus there are three possible arrangements for the photons from
				the beam splitter: both upwards, both downwards, or one upwards and one
				downwards.</P> 
			 <P>Which of these three possibilities has occurred can be determined
				if we put detectors in the paths of the photons after they have left the beam
				splitter.</P> 
			 <P>However, in the case of one photon going upwards and the other
				going downwards, we can not tell which is which. Perhaps both photons were
				reflected by the beam splitter, but perhaps both were transmitted.</P> 
			 <P>This means that the two photons have become <I>entangled</I>.</P> 
			 <P>If we have a large beam of identically prepared photon pairs
				incident on the beam splitter, the case of one photon ending up going upwards
				and the other downwards occurs, perhaps surprisingly, 25% of the time.</P></TD>

		</TR> 
	 </TABLE> 
	 <P>Also somewhat surprisingly, for a single pair of photons incident on the
		beam splitter, the photon <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I> has now
		collapsed into a state where its polarization is -45<SUP>0</SUP>, the opposite
		polarization of the prepared 45<SUP>0</SUP> one. This is because the photons
		have become entangled. So although we don't know which photon is which, we know
		the polarizations of both of them.</P> 
	 <P>The explanation of these two somewhat surprising results is beyond the
		level of this discussion, but can be explained by the <I>phase shifts</I> the
		light experiences when reflected, the mixture of polarization states of
		<I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I>, and the consequent <I>interference</I>
		between the two photons.</P> <HR> 
	 <H2 ALIGN="CENTER">THE TELEPORTER</H2> 
	 <TABLE WIDTH="100%"> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD> 
			 <P>Now we shall think about the <I><FONT
				COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT></I> companion to <I><FONT
				COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I>.</P> 
			 <P>25 percent of the time, the Bell-state measurement resulted in the
				circumstance shown, and in these cases we have collapsed the state of the
				<I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT></I> photon into a state where its
				polarization is -45<SUP>0</SUP>.</P> 
			 <P>But since the two photon system <FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT>
				and <FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT> was prepared with opposite polarizations,
				this means that the companion to <FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT>, <I><FONT
				COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT></I>, now has a polarization of +45<SUP>0</SUP>. Thus
				the state of the <I><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">K</FONT></I> photon has now been
				transferred to the <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT></I> photon. We have
				teleported the information about the <I><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">K</FONT></I>
				photon to <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT></I>.</P> 
			 <P>Although this collapse of <I><FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT></I>
				into a 45<SUP>0</SUP> polarization state occurs instantaneously, we haven't
				achieved teleportation until we communicate that the Bell-state measurement has
				yielded the result shown. Thus the teleportation does not occur
				instantaneously.</P> 
			 <P>Note that the teleportation has destroyed the state of the
				original <I><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">K</FONT></I> photon.</P> 
			 <P>Quantum entanglements such as exist between <FONT
				COLOR="#0099FF">E1</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#0099FF">E2</FONT> in principle are
				independent of how far apart the two photons become. This has been
				experimentally verified for distances as large as 10km. Thus, the Quantum
				Teleportation is similarly independent of the distance.</P></TD>

	 </TABLE>
<H3>The Original State of the Teleported Photon <EM>Must</EM> Be Destroyed</H3>
<P>Above we saw that the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">K</FONT> photon's state was destroyed 
  when the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">E2</FONT> photon acquired it. Consider for a 
  moment that this was not the case, so we end up with two photons with identical 
  polarization states. Then we could measure the polarization of one of the photons 
  at, say, 45<SUP>0</SUP> and the other photon at 22.5<SUP>0</SUP>. Then we would 
  know the polarization state of both photons for both of those angles.</P>
<P>As we saw in our discussion of Bell's Theorem, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle 
  says that this is impossible: we can never know the polarization of a photon 
  for these two angles. Thus any teleporter must destroy the state of the object 
  being teleported.</P>
<HR> 
	 <H2 ALIGN="CENTER">OTHER APPLICATIONS</H2> 
	 <P>Teleporting the polarization state of a single photon a quarter of the
		time is a long long way from reliably teleporting Captain Kirk. However, there
		are other applications of the above sort of apparatus that may be closer to
		being useful.</P> 
	 <H3>Quantum Information</H3> 
	 <P>As you probably know, computers store information as sequences of
		<I>0</I>'s and <I>1</I>'s. For example, in the <I>ASCII</I> encoding the letter
		<I>A</I> is represented by the number 65. As a binary number this is:</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><TT>1,000,001</TT></P> 
	 <P>Inside the computer, there are transistors that are either on or off,
		and we assign the on-state be <I>1</I> and the off state <I>0</I>. However, the
		same information can be stored in exactly the same way in any system that has
		two mutually exclusive binary states.</P> 
	 <P>For example, if we have a collection photons we could represent the
		<I>1</I>'s as photons whose polarization is +45<SUP>0</SUP> and the <I>0</I>'s
		as polarizations of -45<SUP>0</SUP>. We could similarly use electrons with
		spin-up and spin-down states to encode the information. These quantum bits of
		information are called <I>qubits</I>.</P> 
	 <P>Above we were thinking about an apparatus to do Quantum Teleportation.
		Now we see that we can think of the same apparatus as transferring Quantum
		Information. Note that, as opposed to, say, a fax, when transferring Quantum
		Information the original, the polarization of the <I><FONT
		COLOR="#FF3300">K</FONT></I> photon, is destroyed.</P> 
	 <H3>Quantum Cryptography</H3> 
	 <P>Cryptography depends on both the sender and receiver of the encrypted
		information both knowing a <I>key</I>. The sender uses the key to encrypt the
		information and the receiver uses the same key to decrypt it.</P> 
	 <P>The key can be something very simple, such as both parties knowing that
		each letter has been shifted up by 13 places, with letters above the thirteenth
		in the alphabet rotated to the beginning. Or they can be very complex, such as
		a very very long string of binary digits.</P> 
	 <P>Here is an example of using binary numbers to encrypt and decrypt a
		message, in this case the letter <I>A</I>, which we have seen is
		<TT>1,000,001</TT> in a binary ASCII encoding. We shall use as the key the
		number 23, which in binary is <TT>0,010,111</TT>. We will use the key to encode
		the letter using a rule that if the corresponding bits of the letter and key
		are the same, the result is a <I>1</I>, and otherwise a <I>0</I>.</P>

	 </TABLE> 
	 <P>Any classical encryption scheme is vulnerable on two counts:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>If the "bad guys" get hold of the key they too can decrypt the
		  message. So-called <I>public key</I> encryptation schemes reveals on an open
		  channel a long string of binary digits which must be converted to the key by
		  means of a secret procedure; here security is based on the computational
		  complexity of "cracking" the secret procedure.</LI> 
		<LI>Because there are patterns in all messages, such as the fact that the
		  letter <I>e</I> predominates, then if multiple messages are intercepted using
		  the same key the bad guys can begin to decipher them.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>To be really secure, then, there must be a unique secret key for each
		message. So the question becomes how can we generate a unique key and be sure
		that the bad guys don't know what it is.</P> 
	 <P>To send a key in <I>Quantum Cryptography</I>, simply send photons in one
		of four polarizations: -45, 0, 45, or 90 degrees. As you know, the receiver can
		measure, say, whether or not a photon is polarized at 90 degrees and if it is
		not then be sure than it was polarized at 0 degrees. Similarly the receiver can
		measure whether a photon was polarized at 45 degrees, and if it is not then it
		is surely polarized at -45 degrees. However the receiver can not measure both
		the 0 degree state and 45 degree state, since the first measurement destroys
		the information of the second one, regardless of which one is performed
		first.</P> 
	 <P>The receiver measures the incoming photons, randomly choosing whether to
		measure at 90 degrees or 45 degrees, and records the results but keeps them
		secret. The receiver contacts the sender and tells her on an open channel which
		type of measurement was done for each, without revealing the result. The sender
		tells the receiver which of the measurements were of the correct type. Both the
		sender and receiver keep only the qubits that were measured correctly, and they
		have now formed the key.</P> 
	 <P>If the bad guys intercept the transmission of photons, measure their
		polarizations, and then send them on to the receiver, they will inevitably
		introduce errors because they don't know which polarization measurement to
		perform. The two legitimate users of the quantum channel test for eavesdropping
		by revealing a random subset of the key bits and checking the error rate on an
		open channel. Although they cannot prevent eavesdropping, they will never be
		fooled by an eavesdropper because any, however subtle and sophisticated, effort
		to tap the channel will be detected. Whenever they are not happy with the
		security of the channel they can try to set up the key distribution again.</P> 
	 <P>By February 2000 a working Quantum Cryptography system using the above
		scheme achieved the admittedly modest rates of 10 bits per second over a 30 cm
		length.</P> 
	 
<P>There is another method of Quantum Cryptography which uses entangled photons. 
  A sequence of correlated particle pairs is generated, with one member of each 
  pair being detected by each party (for example, a pair of photons whose polarisations 
  are measured by the parties). An eavesdropper on this communication would have 
  to detect a particle to read the signal, and retransmit it in order for his 
  presence to remain unknown. However, the act of detection of one particle of 
  a pair destroys its quantum correlation with the other, and the two parties 
  can easily verify whether this has been done, without revealing the results 
  of their own measurements, by communication over an open channel.</P>
