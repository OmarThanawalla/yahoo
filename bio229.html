            <h3>What Is a Biological Database?</h3>
            <p>A <b>biological database</b> is a large, organized body of persistent 
              data, usually associated with computerized software designed to 
              update, query, and retrieve components of the data stored within 
              the system. A simple database might be a single file containing 
              many records, each of which includes the same set of information. 
              For example, a record associated with a nucleotide sequence database 
              typically contains information such as contact name, the input sequence 
			  with a description of the type of molecule, the scientific name of the 
			  source organism from which it was isolated, and often, literature citations 
              associated with the sequence.</p>
            <span>For researchers to benefit from the data stored in a database, 
            two additional requirements must be met: 
            <ul>
              <li>easy access to the information<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>a method for extracting only that information needed to answer 
                a specific biological question</li>
            </ul>

              (pronounced ahn' tray) allows a user to not only access and retrieve 
              specific information from a single database but to access integrated information 
              from many NCBI databases. For example, the Entrez Protein database 
              is cross-linked to the Entrez Taxonomy database. This allows a researcher 
              to find taxonomic information (<b>taxonomy</b> is a division 
              of the natural sciences that deals with the classification of animals 
              and plants) for the species from which a protein sequence was derived.</p>

            <p><b>Bioinformatics</b> is the field of science in which biology, 
              computer science, and information technology merge to form a single 
              discipline. The ultimate goal of the field is to enable the discovery 
              of new biological insights as well as to create a global perspective 
              from which unifying principles in biology can be discerned. At the 
              beginning of the "genomic revolution", a bioinformatics concern 
              was the creation and maintenance of a database to store biological 
              information, such as nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Development of this 
			  type of database involved not only design issues but the development 
			  of complex interfaces whereby researchers could both access 
			  existing data as well as submit new or revised data.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, however, all of this information must be combined to 
              form a comprehensive picture of normal cellular activities so that 
              researchers may study how these activities are altered in different 
              disease states. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved 
              such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation 
              of various types of data, including nucleotide and amino acid sequences, 
              protein domains, and protein structures. The actual process of analyzing 
              and interpreting data is referred to as <b>computational biology</b>. 
              Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational

                large data sets, such as methods to locate a gene within a sequence, 
                predict protein structure and/or function, and cluster protein 
                sequences into families of related sequences

            <p>Equally exciting is the potential for uncovering evolutionary relationships 
              and patterns between different forms of life. With the aid of nucleotide 
              and protein sequences, it should be possible to find the ancestral 
              ties between different organisms. Thus far, experience has taught 
              us that closely related organisms have similar sequences and that 
              more distantly related organisms have more dissimilar sequences. 
              Proteins that show a significant sequence conservation, indicating 
              a clear evolutionary relationship, are said to be from the same <b>protein 
              family</b>. By studying <b>protein folds</b> (distinct protein building 
              blocks) and families, scientists are able to reconstruct the evolutionary 
              relationship between two species and to estimate the time of divergence

            <h4>Protein Modeling</h4>
            <p>The process of evolution has resulted in the production of DNA 
              sequences that encode proteins with specific functions. In the absence 
              of a protein structure that has been determined by X-ray crystallography 
              or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, researchers can try to 
			  predict the three-dimensional structure using <b>protein or molecular modeling</b>. 
			  This method uses experimentally determined protein structures <b>(templates)</b> 
              to predict the structure of another protein that has a similar amino 
              acid sequence <b>(target)</b>.</p>
            <p>Although molecular modeling may not be as accurate at determining 
              a protein's structure as experimental methods, it is still extremely 
              helpful in proposing and testing various biological hypotheses. 
              Molecular modeling also provides a starting point for researchers 
              wishing to confirm a structure through X-ray crystallography and 
              NMR spectroscopy. Because the different genome projects are producing 
              more sequences and because novel protein folds and families are 
              being determined, protein modeling will become an increasingly important 
              tool for scientists working to understand normal and disease-related 
              processes in living organisms.</p>

            <h3>Genome Mapping</h3>
            <p><b>Genomic maps</b> serve as a scaffold for orienting sequence 
              information. A few years ago, a researcher wanting to localize a 
              gene, or nucleotide sequence, was forced to manually map the genomic 
              region of interest, a time-consuming and often painstaking process. 
              Today, thanks to new technologies and the influx of sequence data, 
              a number of high-quality, genome-wide maps are available to the 
              scientific community for use in their research.</p>
            <p>Computerized maps make gene hunting faster, cheaper, and more practical 
              for almost any scientist. In a nutshell, scientists would first 
              use a genetic map to assign a gene to a relatively small area of 
              a chromosome. They would then use a physical map to examine the 
              region of interest close up, to determine a gene's precise 
              location. In light of these advances, a researcher's burden has 
              shifted from mapping a genome or genomic region of interest to 
              navigating a vast number of Web sites and databases.</p>

            <h3>Map Viewer: A Tool for Visualizing Whole Genomes or Single Chromosomes</h3>
                   
            <p>NCBI's <b><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/">Map 
              Viewer</a></b> is a tool that allows a user to view 
              an organism's complete genome, integrated maps for each chromosome 
              (when available), and/or sequence data for a genomic region of interest. 
              When using Map Viewer, a researcher has the option of selecting 
              either a "Whole-Genome View" or a "Chromosome or Map View". The 
              Genome View displays a schematic for all of an organism�s chromosomes, 
              whereas the Map View shows one or more detailed maps for a single 
              chromosome. If more than one map exists for a chromosome, Map Viewer 
              allows a display of these maps simultaneously.</p>

            hypotheses or to design large-scale experiments. The implications behind
