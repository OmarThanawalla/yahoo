<p><strong>An important note about Barn Owls:</strong></p>
<p>The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is one of the most wide-spread of all land birds. Sometimes they are called monkey-faced owls because of their appearance. Other common names are church owl, golden owl, rat owl, and stone owl.</p>
<p>They are found on all continents (except Antarctica) and large islands and occur over the whole of Australia, including Tasmania. </p>
<p>The Barn Owl is found in virtually all habitats but much more abundantly in open woodland, heaths and moors than forested country. They usually roost by day in tree hollows but have also been found in caves, wells, out-buildings or thick foliage.</p>
<p>Barn Owls feed on voles, frogs and insects, but are economically valuable birds as they also prey on animal pests like rats, shrews, moles and mice.</p>
<p>Like most birds, Barn Owls do not have teeth to chew their food.&nbsp; Once caught, the Barn Owls prey is swallowed whole.&nbsp; In some cases larger prey may be ripped into more manageable size pieces before being swallowed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After being swallowed the prey is then processed by the Barn Owl so that the owl can make use of all the nutrients it needs to survive.</p>
<p>The prey goes directly to the gizzard where it is broken apart by digestive enzymes.&nbsp; The bones and hair that are not digested and utilized by the owl are later regurgitated in the form of a pellet.</p>
<p>Small compact balls composed of fur, bones and feathers.&nbsp; Regurgitated by an owl after feeding, these pellets can reveal the type of critters that are preyed upon by the owl and give students an idea of predator-prey relationships.</p>
<p>Barn Owls have a notable shreee scream, ear-shattering at close range. They also hiss like steam kettles. When captured or cornered, they throw themselves on their backs and flail with sharp-taloned feet, an effective defense.</p>
<p>Barn owls were numerous until the late 1980s, however in recent years the population of the Barn Owl has diminished.&nbsp; We can attribute the owl's decline to a number of factors: old barns being torn down, grasslands reverting to woods or farmland being gobbled up by urban sprawl.</p>
<p>Niles Biological is one of the World's largest suppliers of <a href="http://www.nilesbio.com/cat452.html">Owl Pellets</a>. Naturally from both an economic and an environmental point of View, the welfare of our business as well as the welfare of our many owl pellet collectors is reliant on the ability for the Barn Owl to thrive.&nbsp; In an effort to study the effects of Urban Sprawl, and other factors we are looking for Collectors in new areas so that we can analyze <a href="http://www.nilesbio.com/cat452.html">pellets</a> from these new areas to compare that information with our current data.</p>
<p>If you would like information on how you can make an income by collecting <a href="http://www.nilesbio.com/cat452.html">owl pellets</a> please contact me at <a href="mailto:ted@nilesbio.com">ted@nilesbio.com</a>&nbsp; use the subject line: owl pellet income, or Owl pellet research.&nbsp; Be sure to include you name, e-mail, and contact phone numbers.</p>		</td>
