The Pleiades are, according to Greek mythology, the seven daughters of
<a href="../hr/1178.html">Atlas</a>, the titan who holds up the sky,
and the Oceanid named <a href="../hr/1180.html">Pleione</a>.  The
sisters are <a href="../hr/1165.html">Alcyone</a>, <a
href="../hr/1149.html">Maia</a>, <a
href="../hr/1142.html">Electra</a>, <a
href="../hr/1145.html">Taygeta</a>, <a
href="../hr/1140.html">Celaeno</a>, <a
href="../hr/1156.html">Merope</a> and <a
href="../hr/1151.html">Sterope</a>.  The Great Hunter, <a
href="../constellations/Orion.html">Orion</a>, fell in love with them
and chased them for seven years.

Today there are only six stars in the Pleiades that are easily visible
with the naked eye.  There are many theories about what happened to
the 7th one.  Celaeno has often been called the "Lost Pleiad" because
she was hit by lightning according to mythology.  In reality, the star
we call Celaeno is just at the limit of human vision in terms of
brightness.
