<p>
The orbital images on this page represent the shape of the atomic orbitals.  
The clouds you see are the probability distribution of an electron bound 
to a Hydrogen nucleus.

<p>
These images were created using

a scientific and educational program that aids in visualizing the Hydrogenic 
atomic orbitals, a prime and otherwise unwieldy example of quantum mechanics.

Unlike other tools in this category, this program raytraces through a
three-dimensional cloud density that represents the wavefunction's
probability density and presents its results in real-time (up to 48 frames
per second on the latest hardware).  The user interface is very interactive
and provides a wide degree of flexibility. 
</p>

<p>
It contains all 140 eigenstates up to the n=7 energy level and the allowed
spectral transitions between those eigenstates.  It also allows a state
formed by a superposition (<a href="#images">see below</a>) of up to eight of those eigenstates allowing for
over 3 trillion possible states.  The program can display a wavefunction as a
picture of a cloud, use color as phase, plot in red-cyan left/right for 3D
glasses, and slice the wavefunction.

<b>What is Quantum Mechanics?</b>
</p><p>
 One of the great advances in human knowledge of the twentieth century is the birth of 
the theory of Quantum mechanics.  It has led to some of the most common technologies 
used today, including the little transistors that make up the computers you're using 
to read this.  
One of the mysteries it revealed was the structure of the atom.  Classical mechanics 
could not properly explain the existence of the atom.  
Because there was nothing to stop electrons from 
spiralling in to the nucleus, it predicted that 
all atoms would immediately destroy themselves in a spectacular high-energy blast of 
radiation.  
</p>

<p>
Well, that obviously doesn't happen.  
Quantum mechanics describes that the electron (and all of the universe for that matter) 
exists in any of a multitude of states.  
The particular physical situation determines what and how many states there are.  
Borrowing from some of the techniques in mathematics, physicists organize these states 
into a particular set of mathematically convenient states called "eigenstates".  
Eigenstates are good to use because 
what makes one eigenstate different 
from another usually has a physical meaning.  
They also can make an horribly difficult problem managable.  
These and other phenomena in Quantum mechanics predict 
that possiblities in physical phenomena have distinct separations (e.g., "quantum leaps") 
and that energy transport exists as indivisible packets, called "quanta".  
Hence the name: Quantum Mechanics.  
</p>

<p>
<b>What are Orbitals?</b>
</p><p>
By applying these techniques to the hydrogen atom, physicists are able to 
precisely predict all of its properties.  
The electron eigenstates around the nucleus are called "orbitals", in a rough 
correspondence with how the Moon orbits the Earth.  
We find that these states do not allow the electron to crash into the nucleus, but 
instead find themselves in any combination of these orbital eigenstates.  
These orbitals' physical structure describe effects from how atoms bond to form compounds, 
magnetism, the size of atoms, the structure of crystals, 
to the structure of matter that we see around us.  
</p>

<p>
Visualizing these states has been a challenge, because the 
mathematics that describe the eigenfunctions are not simple and the states are a 
three-dimensional structures.  The standard convention has the orbital eigenstates 
indexed by three interrelated integer indicies, called n, l, and m.  
Their range and interdependence comes out of the math in deriving the eigenstates.  
n can range from 1 to infinity.  l can range from 0 to n-1.  m can range from -l to +l.  
They also have physical meaning.  The energy of the state, which is negative 
because the electron is bound to the nucleus, depends only on n and 
increases as n increases.  l refers to the amount of angular momentum the electron 
has due to its "orbit" around the nucleus.  l is not equal to the amount of 
angular momentum but goes up as angular momentum goes up.  m determines how much of the 
angular momentum is in the z direction.  (However, the rest of the angular momentum 
is <i>not</i> l minus m or anything that simple.  
That's a long story that I can't fit here.  
Look in a Quantum textbook 
(a good one is <i>A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics</i> by John S. Townsend),  
take a course, or talk to a physics professor.)

<b>What's here for me?</b>
</p><p>
I have written a Macintosh application 
that displays atomic orbitals in real-time.  
Rather than just a plot of the spherical harmonics, as is shown in many 
Quantum mechanics textbooks, this program displays the electron orbital as a cloud.  
The cloud's density is determined by the orbital's probability density for the 
electron.  
There are three examples on this web page: The one at the top is the n=3, l=2, m=0 state;
the screenshot above has n=7, l=4, m=0; the first example below is n=6, l=4, m=1.  
(The quality is poor so that they wouldn't take too long to download over the Internet.  
They'll look even worse if you are not using Millions of colors to view it.  
The program looks quite a bit better, trust me.)  
With the program, you can rotate the orbital around in real time.  If you have 
red-cyan 3-D glasses, you can see it in 3-D too.  
The program has all the orbital eigenstates up to n=7, which is the 
highest occupied shell for the ground states of the 
heaviest elements, e.g., Uranium, Plutonium, etc.  
</p>

<p>
You can download the application, the 
<a href=OrbitalsCarbon.hqx><b>Atom in a Box, a.k.a. Orbitals, v1.0.8</b></a> 
(~472k PowerPC only, <a href="http://asu.info.apple.com/">CarbonLib</a> required), 
from here and have a look.  
The program is computation intensive, so it requires a PowerPC Macintosh or 
Macintosh-compatible to run.  
For individual users, this is US $20 shareware.  
You can see the details in the about box or the Read Me.  
Also supplied are example orbital files.  
</p>

<p>
v1.0.8 will run on both OS 9 (with <a href="http://asu.info.apple.com/">CarbonLib</a>) 
and OS X.  
The latest pre-Carbon version of <a href=Orbitals.hqx><b>Atom in a Box, v1.0.4</b></a>
is also available.  See the READ ME for more details.  
</p>

<p>
<a href=Orbitals68k.hqx><b>Atom in a Box, a.k.a. Orbitals, v1.0.4, for 68k</b></a>
is available, but it's really slow (not real-time: 3 seconds per frame on a //ci).
