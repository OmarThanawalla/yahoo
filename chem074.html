&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is an intimate connection between the early solar nebula and the
interstellar medium from which it formed.  Thus, the study of current
star-forming environments can tell us much about how we came to be.
The combination of rapidly improving observational tools and increasingly
sophisticated theory has provided, for the first time, a broad outline
of the physical processes associated with the assembly of Sun-like stars
and their attendant planetary systems.  The figure below presents an
overview of the scenario developed for the formation of a single,
isolated low mass star from the collapse of a molecular cloud core.
Despite these impressive gains, many crucial details are poorly understood.
In addition, the scope of the problem of stellar and planetary formation
has broadened drastically with the discovery of massive extra-solar planets
(for up to the date information on this exciting research, go to the
<a href="http://exoplanets.org/science.html">
<b>UC Berkeley/Carnegie</b></a> or the 
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/planets/">
<b>Meudon</b></a> exoplanet web sites)
Furthermore, stars are by their nature gregarious.  Whether they are part
of a multiple system or members of an association, the majority of stars
are born in environments that are considerably more complex than
that outlined below.  The characterization of star-forming
regions therefore presents considerable challenges both observationally
and theoretically.<br>

magnetic support is overcome and inside-out collapse begins at <i>t=0</i>. 
(Top right) For ~10,000-100,000 yr a phase of both high accretion and
supersonic outflow occurs in deeply embedded protostars. 
(Bottom left) Gradual clearing by the outflow leaving only the young T Tauri
star and a residual protoplanetary accretion disk,
that, on time scales of 1-10 million years, leads to the
formation of a mature planetary system (bottom right).<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To this table chemistry does not arrive empty-handed.  Indeed, observations of
molecules play a pivotal role in understanding the physical and chemical
evolution of star-forming molecular cloud cores and primitive solar systems. 
This occurs because the tremendous range in physical conditions and size
scales that are present in young stellar objects (YSOs), where densities from
10<sup>4</sup> to >10<sup>13</sup> molecules/cm<sup>3</sup> and
temperatures of 10 - 10,000 K exist over distances from a few stellar
radii to many thousands of
astronomical units (AU), is perhaps best probed by molecular spectroscopy. 
Over one hundred <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~awootten/allmols.html">
<b>interstellar molecules</b></a> are now known, and they
also provide direct access to the velocity fields present in cloud
cores with hundreds to thousands of magnitudes of extinction, while their
abundances provide constraints on the internal and external radiation fields.
A significant fraction of the molecules is condensed in icy mantles on dust
grains, which contain important information on the temperature and irradiation
history of the region. Finally, since chemistry controls critical physical
parameters in star formation such as the fractional ionization
and cooling of the gas, a detailed understanding of the chemical composition
of the gas and dust surrounding young stars is important and interesting
in its own right. For those interested in learning more, the 
<a href="http://www.astrochemistry.net">
<b>Astrochemistry web site</b></a> is a great place to start.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We are carrying out an observational study of the star and planet formation
process using Caltech's extraordinary suite of telescopes, including the
Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) Millimeter Array, the Caltech
Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), and the Keck telescopes:<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.ovro.caltech.edu/" align="left">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org" a>
<img src= "keck_twilight.jpg" height= "100"></a><br><br>
Specifically, we are using a variety of molecular line tracers and dust
continuum emission to characterize the physical and chemical processes
at work in objects ranging from deeply embedded protostars such as those
in the NGC 1333 molecular cloud (IRAS 2, IRAS 4, etc.) to several million
year old T Tauri (LkCa 15, GM Aur) and Herbig Ae stars (MWC 480, HD163296).
The ties between these objects and the formation of planetary systems are
tested by examining primitive solar system bodies such as Kuiper Belt
Objects and, as they appear, comets (c.f. our studies of comets 
OVRO Hale-Bopp and C/1999 S4 LINEAR).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our most recent work has centered on a characterization of the chemistry
within the pre-planetary accretion disks around 1-5 Myr old T Tauri stars,
most of which possess remnant accretion disks with masses of ~0.001-0.1
M(sun) and sizes of ~100 AU, comparable to those inferred for
the primitive solar nebula.  Such circumstellar disks  can  serve  as 
models  for the understanding  of 
our own pre-solar  nebula.  The  assessment  of the chemical
composition at each radius of the disk would provide  valuable  information 
(i.e.  density, thermal history and composition)  about the initial conditions 
in the planet-forming  zones of the solar nebula and help  determine the 
origin and evolution of primitive bodies such as comets and Kuiper Belt
Objects.  In addition,  molecular 
emission studies of accretion disks can facillitate  the  quantification  
of gas-to-dust  ratios and the timescales  over which they are dissipated,
disk properties of great importance for the process of planet formation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Previous single dish work has detected emission from species such as
HCN, CN, HNC, CS, ... and revealed that both ion-molecule chemistry
and photon-dominated chemistry must contribute to the observed abundances,
since ratios such as CN/HCN are too high to be accounted for by quiescent 
chemical models alone.
A fuller understanding of the details 
of disk chemistry obviously requires interferometric images of several 
species in each important chemical family (C-, N-, O-, and S-bearing) 
with the kind of sensitivity, dynamic range, and high spatial resolution 
(<1-2&acute;&acute)
that has only recently become possible, and that were begun with the OVRO
Millimeter Array over the last two years.  Results from our study of
the T Tauri star LkCa 15, summarized in the figures below, have revealed
interesting morphological differences between different chemical families.
CN and HCN, for example, showed maximum emission for both 
species at distances of a few hundred AU from the central star.  This 
offset demands that the HCN and CN be formed <i>in situ</i>, and the 
location of the maxima may be related to the sublimation and UV
processing of CO trapped in icy dust grain mantles (i.e. the CO "frost
line").  The release of CO, but not water, drives a carbon-rich gas
phase and grain mantle chemistry in certain disk models.<br><br>
<center><img src= "lkca15_cocnhcn.gif"></center><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The observed chemical differentiation in LkCa 15 (and the Herbig Ae
star HD 163296) opens
the door to the detailed characterization of the physical and chemical
processing in protoplanetary accretion disks. In order to reach quantitative
conclusions, however, it is necessary to observe various species at higher 
resolution and to interpret them with detailed 
<a href="http://talisker.as.arizona.edu/~michiel/ratran.html">
<b>radiative transfer models</b></a>.   Both our observing programs
and theoretical work are carried out in collaboration with
Prof. <a href="http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~ewine">
<b>Ewine van Dishoeck</b></a> and her
<a href="http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/astrochem/persons.html">
<b>Molecular Astrophysics Group</b></a>
at the Sterrewacht Leiden. Since the observed structure is
similar to the beam size, the true underlying morphology may
be smaller still.  Is the observed offset along the disk
major axis consistent with a ring-like geometry? To help
address this questions, detailed 2D radiative transfer
calculations, outlined below, are underway. With the
presently available sensitivity, the calculations do indeed
reproduce the OVRO images; the emission along the disk minor
axis is simply too weak to be detectable at present.<br><br>
<center><img src= "disk_ring.gif"></center><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Observations
with improved sensitivity and image quality are therefore critical,
and the merging of the OVRO and BIMA millimeter arrays into a single
instrument, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
Astronony, or <a href="http://www.mmarray.org/"><b>CARMA</b></a>,
will be an important step towards this goal. The combined array
will be situated at a new higher altitude site in the Inyo mountains
of California near the present OVRO array. The site, Cedar Flat,
and CARMA D-array layout are shown below.
With much improved atmospheric transmission and 105 baselines,
CARMA will possess nearly an order of magnitude more sensitivity
and vastly enhanced imaging performance compared to the existing arrays.
Groundbreaking for CARMA occurred on March 27th, 2004, and construction
on the new site is underway.

<img src= "carma_road_small.jpg" height="250"></center><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Near the end of this decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (or 
<a href="http://www.alma.nrao.edu"><b>ALMA</b></a>) will come into
operation.  This collaborative effort between the United States, Europe
and Japan aims to construct a 64 element array of 12 meter telescopes at
the extraordinarily dry Chajnantor plateau in northern Chile:<br><br>
<center><img src= "chajantor_small.jpg"></center><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the dramatic increase in collecting area and improved atmospheric
conditions, ALMA will be able to image the dust and line emission from
pre-planetary accretion disk in extraordinary detail.  The simulation
below, courtesy of Lee Mundy at the University of Maryland, illustrates
well the expected capabilities of ALMA.  The disk has a central hole
3 AU in radius, a roughly 2 AU wide cleared ring centered at 7 AU with
soft edge, a protoplanet overdensity at 9 AU with a Gaussian FWHM of
2 AU and a factor of 9 overdensity, a protoplanet overdensity at 22 AU with
a Gaussian FMWH of 1.5 AU and a factor of 6 overdensity, and
a protoplanet overdensity at 37 AU with a Gaussian FWHM of 3 AU and
a factor of 4 overdensity.  Each of the protoplanets also has an
underdensity of 10 percent in a ring at the same orbital radius.
To test the image fidelity, the word ALMA written in the lower part
of the disk with an overdensity of a factor of 2 on the underlying disk
The leters are 12 pixels wide and 100 pixels high - that is roughly
4 AU by 35 AU. The word ALMA is also written in the upper part of
the disk with an underdensity of 20 percent.  The model images are at
right, while the simulations from a single ALMA transit with perfect
phase calibration but the estimated thermal noise level lie at left.
The protoplanets are clearly visible, and chemical gradients such as
those discussed above should be extremely well resolved!
