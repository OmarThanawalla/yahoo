<b><i>Summary: </i></b> We propose an Internet based standard based on primary
chemical MIME types to be used in conjunction with the the World-Wide-Web
information delivery system. We show how this allows the user to have access to
and control of molecular structural and spectroscopic information transparently
integrated into scientific publications. We illustrate this with examples of
what we have termed "hyperactive molecules" from the areas of quantitative
structural modelling, organic synthesis, crystallography, molecular dynamics,
nmr, mass and laser emission spectroscopy. The on-screen annotation of 3D
molecular diagrams is achieved using a Chemical Structure Markup Language
(CSML), and is illustrated with hyperlinks embedded in <i>e.g.</i>  two
dimensional diagrams in NMR spectra. The implications of these mechanisms for
scientific publication in general, the impact on the quality and
reproducibility of published experimental data and the enhancement of
serendipitous discoveries are discussed.<p>
<p>
<b><i>Introduction.</i></b> The development of molecular co-ordinate and
connectivity information depositories such as the Cambridge structural data
base<a href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a> or the protein data
bank<a href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[2]</a> has been greatly
facilitated during the last two decades by computer, and in particular network
technology. Even so, twelve months or more can often elapse between the
acquisition of such data and the dissemination of this information in the form
of a published research paper. There are often further delays whilst the
information is abstracted and entered into the database, and the latter made
available to users. Its local use may require acquisition of a proprietary or a
commercial program, or require knowledge of a particular search syntax. <p>
<p>
More fundamentally, by far the greater bulk of what is referred to as
`supplemental data' is never made available to the scientific community at
large. In the area of molecular modelling, the lack of a full specification of
the parameters involved in any specific calculation makes many calculations
effectively irreproducible. For example, molecular force fields are rarely
quoted in full, and the final molecular co-ordinates derived from the
minimisation of a large biomolecules are equally unavailable. Much original
spectroscopic data is also "lost" after the original analysis is performed by
authors. The reasons for this are obvious. Traditional methods of information
dissemination, <i>i.e.</i> printed journals and books, simply cannot afford the
space to publish the source data. Furthermore, the possibilities for
transcription errors are likely to make these data useless even if the space
could be found to print them.<p>
<p>
The recent development of the World-Wide-Web, a communications system based on
the global Internet network, offers an interesting solution to at least some of
these problems.<a href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[3]</a> This
mechanism also addresses the mismatch between conventional two dimensional
printed pages and the three dimensional properties of most molecules, a
particularly acute problem for molecules of biological importance. In this
paper, we describe the implementation of what we have called the 'hyperactive
molecule concept' into the World-Wide-Web infra-structure, and illustrate its
use with biologically oriented examples drawn from different areas of
structural, spectroscopic and computational chemistry.<p>
<p>
<b><i>Computational Methodology:- </i></b>The World-Wide-Web operates a
communication protocol known as HTTP (hypertext-transport-protocol) and a text
and graphical markup language known as HTML (hypertext-markup-language). Within
this structure, markup commands known as HTML tags are used to define
hyperlinks within a document identifying the Internet location of other
documents or molecular information. It is the task of the HTTP protocol to
retrieve these remote document fragments and of HTML to display and assemble
the contents in an appropriate and consistent manner on the computer screen.
Programs that implement both the HTTP and the HTML protocols are known as WWW
Browsers. Table 1 contains "anonymous" ftp sites that can be used to acquire
no-cost versions of various browsers and the associated visualisation tools.
Demonstrations of the various concepts discussed in this paper can be achieved
using these programs.<a href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[4]</a> <p>

Using this mechanism a molecule referred to in a document can be associated
with a set of molecular co-ordinates. The co-ordinate data themselves need not
necessarily be stored on the same machine as the document itself since the
remote information is associated with a unique name on the Internet that
enables it to be almost instantly located. Currently, the scheme in operation
uses what are called URLs or Uniform Resource Locators, which specify a precise
physical location for the information. It has been proposed that<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[5]</a> this naming formalism will be
augmented by the more robust URN or Uniform Resource Name, which would allow
relocation of the information in a manner transparent to the user. Use of these
labels allows a close association between the discussion of molecular
properties in a scientific paper and any further information located located on
a remote Internet based system. Such a hyperlink when activated can result in
transfer of <i>e.g. </i>molecular co-ordinates to the reader of the paper,
followed if required by the initiation of some appropriate visualisation
program. Such a mechanism applies equally well to spectroscopic and other forms
of numerical or visual data.<p>
<p>
<b><i>Chemical MIME Types:-</i></b>  Before such a mechanism can be
implemented, some convention must be adopted for identifying the precise format
in which the remote data is defined, and how the data will be processed once it
has been transferred locally. We have chosen to adopt  the MIME formalism, or
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension.<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[6]</a> This specifies a primary MIME
type, which as currently formulated can be any of seven types; <i>text,
application, image, audio, video, message or multipart</i>. These are qualified
with secondary types. For example, the primary text type can be qualified by
secondary types of plain, richtext, postscript, html amongst others. Thus a
MIME specification of <p>
<p>
<tt><i>text/html</i></tt><p>
<p>
would unambiguously indicate a document which can be read using a HTML
compliant program. The existing MIME types however, do not readily correspond
to the variety of chemical information available, and in order to address this
we have proposed in an Internet draft<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[7]</a> that a new primary MIME type
to be called <i>chemical </i>be defined along with a variety of secondary
types. In order that this proposal satisfy the requirements for Internet
ratification, all the secondary types must follow definitions that are readily
available in the literature. It is permissible to use non-standard types, but
these must be clearly indicated with the prefix of an x before the secondary
type name. <p>
<p>
In this paper, we illustrate a number of our proposed MIME types with a number
of working examples, and using freely available WWW browsers (Table 1). To do
this, our proposed MIME types have been configured into the two public
World-Wide-Web HTTP servers, and are accessible via the URL definitions;<p>
<p>
<tt>http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/chemical_mime.html </tt> and <p>
<tt>http://chem.leeds.ac.uk/Project/MIME.html</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt></tt>The molecular information is physically stored on either of these
systems, and the MIME type is identified simply from the suffix given to the
file names. At the reader's end, a World-Wide-Web client program (a browser),
is configured with an identical set of MIME types, each of which is then
associated by the user with a computer program capable of displaying the
content in suitable form. This last action is entirely at the discretion of the
user, who may wish to use an expensive commercial program to visualise
molecular information, or who may simply wish to view it using a simple (and
free) text editor. The specific details of how to associate a program with
specific MIME types are dependent on the type of computer used. On most Unix
workstations for example, a file with the name <b>.mailcap</b> is created in
the users directory with entries of the following type;<p>
<p>
<tt>chemical/x-pdb; rasmol %s</tt><p>
<p>
which indicates that an coordinate file identified with the  secondary MIME
type "x-pdb" will be passed to the RasMol<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[8]</a> program, which is presumed
resident on the users system.<p>
<p>
In Table 2, we list some of the secondary MIME types that have been implemented
on our HTTP servers, together with the application programs we have tested the
concept with. The secondary MIME types <i>x-pdb</i>, <i>x-mopac</i>, and
<i>x-gaussian</i> are fairly obviously associated with protein database, MOPAC,
and Gaussian format files (the x- prefix indicates that formal Internet
ratification is not yet achieved, and will be removed once this is
accomplished). The <i>x-eye2eye</i><b> </b>secondary MIME type is associated
with the EyeChem<a href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[9]</a> module
suite written for Irix Explorer, and allows two users, at spatially separated
sites, to share and manipulate simultaneously a 3D representation of molecular
co-ordinate data. This concept is discussed on more detail below. In
implementing application programs we concentrated on the use of high
performance workstations (SGI IndySC and Sun IPC), but have also evaluated
Macintosh and MS-Windows systems. Although the graphical performance is
inferior on the latter systems, the concept is entirely viable on all the types
of computer we have worked with.<p>

<b><i>Results and Discussion:-</i>  </b> In this paper we illustrate the
concept of chemical MIME types with a number of examples. We focus in
particular on the context of interpretation of spectral and conformational
data. We wish to emphasise, however, that the concept of a chemical MIME type
is generic to chemically related information, and, indeed, we have demonstrated
elsewhere<sup>3</sup> a number of other applications. The conventional paper
based medium of this journal has certain difficulties when it comes to
demonstrating these concepts in action. The URL references given above should
therefore be consulted for "working" versions of the examples discussed
below.<p>
<p>
<b><i>Hyperactive Proteins:</i></b> - The first example relates to the proposed
protein database format (pdb), which  is an accepted standard data format for
the representation of protein structures amongst chemists and molecular
biologists . Coordinate information of this kind is virtually incomprehensible
without some form of graphical visualisation, but fortunately there are many
excellent graphical programs that support this format. In our implementation, a
two-tier system of hyperlinks has been adopted. The first hyperlink invokes a
small bit-mapped graphical image or thumbnail sketch of the molecule, which
serves to identify the nature of the molecule and assists as a browsing
mechanism to attract readers interest. Such images are normally relatively
small computer files and do not take much time to transfer across the Internet
network. This icon is itself then linked to the pdb coordinate file, which is
transferred to the local system using the <i>chemical/x-pdb </i>MIME definition
and passed as input data to a visualiser (Figure 1).<p>
 <p>
<b><A HREF="fig1.gif">Figure 1 here</A></b><p>
<p>
In principle any suitable application program could be associated with the MIME
type chemical/x-pdb, but we have specifically investigated the use of RasMol,
XMol<a href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[10]</a>, and EyeChem, which
are all easily obtainable by anonymous ftp over the Internet. These programs in
turn allow the user to change the viewing position of the coordinates, to add
other features such as a ribbon representation and to further manipulate the
data. In principal, the data could be passed<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[11]</a> to a computationally based
program such as <i>e.g.</i> MOPAC<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[12]</a>, where appropriate
calculations derived from the coordinates could be made. In this way, the
concept of a `hyperactive molecule' greatly enhances the value of the original
document. It also serves as a powerful quality control mechanism, since the
scientific integrity of the data can be assessed both at the refereeing stage
and subsequently, without the difficulties that are associated with the present
mechanism of waiting for the co-ordinates to be deposited in a single
world-wide database.<p>
<p>
<b><i>Quantum Chemically Derived Data:</i></b> - The concept can be extended to
input and output files derived from MOPAC and Gaussian 92 calculations.<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[13]</a> The visualisers we used were
XMol and EyeChem on the X-Windows systems and CAChe, Ball-and-Stick and Chem3D
on Macintosh computers. The hyperactive molecules allow the results of the
original calculations to be visualised, and enable these calculations to be
readily repeated if necessary. If a new molecular property is desired, it could
be calculated on-the-fly in the context of reading (or indeed refereeing) the
original paper. A specific application of this is the annotation of a
conformational energy map<a href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[14]</a>
for the rotation of the two hydroxyl groups in the di-axial conformation of
<i>cis</i> 1,3 cyclohexane-diol. Particular regions of the isometric projection
of this map are hyperlinked to molecular co-ordinates stored on the Web server.
By clicking with the cursor on these hot-spots, the relevant co-ordinates can
be acquired and the particular orientation of the hydroxyl groups as a function
of the calculated energy verified (Figure 2).<p>
<p>
<b><A HREF="fig2.gif">Figure 2 here</A></b><p>
<p>
Calculation output files often contain a rich body of information that is
rarely published. Often, the view is taken that it is actually easier to repeat
the original calculation from the start than to try to acquire such
supplemental information.  We have demonstrated that such output files, if
identified with an appropriate MIME type, can be readily retrieved and
processed. For example, a MOPAC force calculation can be retrieved and a
particular normal vibrational mode animated to reveal the form of the
vibration. A Gaussian log file corresponding to 15 cycles of a geometry
optimisation can be displayed in animated form. For both these visualisations,
we used the EyeChem package, which allows fine control over the visual
attributes <i>via</i> the Explorer interfaces, although other programs such as
XMol could also be used. A further elaboration is to mount more than one data
file remotely, as for example with MOPAC co-ordinates and a MOPAC density
matrix, which allows the reader to reconstitute not only the ball-and-stick
diagram but also properties such as molecular orbitals and other derived
molecular properties.<p>
<p>
<b><i>Chemical Structure Markup Language and 2D NMR Spectral Annotation:-
</i></b>NMR spectroscopy has proved a powerful technique for deriving three
dimensional structural information. However, the association of particular
features in <i>e.g.</i> a two-dimensional spectrum with molecular structure
requires substantial imagination. The use of hyperlinks embedded within an
image of the spectrum allows a radical departure from the traditional method of
presenting such spectroscopic information. A conventional 2D NOESY spectrum
<i>e.g.</i> of barnase<a href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[15]</a> or
the oligonuclotide CGCGTTTTCGCG<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[16]</a> has a small image of the
biomolecule inserted into a corner, which in turn is hyperlinked to suitable
co-ordinates (Figure 3). <p>
<p>
<b><A HREF="fig3.gif">Figure 3 here</A></b><p>
<p>
When the user activates the cursor in this region, the coordinates are
downloaded and via the mechanism of the <i>chemical/x-pdb</i> MIME type,
visualised using <i>e.g.</i> the RasMol program. This allows the user to select
the best viewing angle and representation of the molecule. Selected cross-peaks
in the NOESY spectrum, in this case representing inter-chain contacts, are
defined as small circular regions on the spectrum corresponding to hyperlinks.
This in turn is associated with a file stored on the HTTP server, and
containing containing structural markup instructions of the type;<p>
<p>
<tt>all white wireframe off</tt><p>
<tt>ala99 red spacefill on</tt><p>
<tt>phe106 red dots on</tt><p>
<p>
These indicates the two residues associated with the nOe term, the colour they
will be rendered on the user's computer, a representational attribute and its
status. This file is allocated a MIME type<i> <tt>chemical/x-csml,</tt></i>
since it formally constitutes what we have defined as a Chemical Structure
Markup Language, or CSML. Clearly the present definition must represent only a
prototype of such a language, and we are indeed currently working on a more
formal specification of such markup commands. <p>
<p>
When the hyperlink is selected, the csml file is retrieved and used as input
data to a small script called<tt> csml </tt>which is itself resident on the
user's local machine and has to be acquired by the user prior to starting the
process. The script in turn sends these instructions to the previously
activated RasMol process, in this instance using the X-11 inter-client
communication protocol implemented with<i> </i>the Tk/Tcl environment, but in
principle <i>via</i> any process-to-process communication channel. The
perception to the user is that as each cross-peak in the window showing the 2D
NMR spectrum is selected, the relevant two residues or atoms in the RasMol
display window are highlighted virtually instantly. It is important to realise
that this process does not occur exclusively on a single computer, but that the
information is transferred in real- time using the Internet between two systems
that may be continents apart. If the <tt>chemical/x-csml</tt> mechanism seems
excessively complex, this in part is due to the quite stringent requirements
for security that the World-Wide-Web protocol mandates. In particular, it is
important that only data is transferred transparently between WWW server and
client, and that no direct instructions are executed on the user's machine
without their overt permission and knowledge. Thus although the <tt>csml</tt>
script is executed, the content and action of this script is entirely under the
control of the local user and not any remote machine. In future, we anticipate
using the recently announced Common-Client-Interface (CCI)<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[17]</a> to achieve more flexible
interaction between the WWW Browser and the molecular viewers.<p>
<p>
Within this metaphor, it is easy to imagine the extension to visually complex
3D NMR data, thus enabling a closer association between such data and 3D
molecular features. This would of course require the definition of further
appropriate secondary chemical MIME types. Currently, NMR data is stored in a
variety of proprietary formats, and there appears to be urgent need for an open
and well defined interchange standard in this area, as for example has been
developed for crystallographic data.<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[18]</a> <p>
<p>
<b><i>Mass Spectral Fragmentation:- </i></b> Mass spectral fragmentations are
also closely associated with structural features in molecules. As the molecule
increases in size and complexity, the analysis becomes more difficult. We have
demonstrated that the fragmentation pattern of a FAB mass spectrum measured for
an permethylated aminocarbohydrate<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[19]</a> can be hyperlinked to an
appropriately annotated 3D structural representation of the compound, in our
case again using the RasMol program and the CSML formalism.  Since the 3D
molecular coordinates are automatically made available to the user, it should
be trivial to extend the analysis to performing local computations using this
information, as for example in calculating the molecular weight of any
particular fragment identified from the hyperlink.<p>
<p>
<b><i>Induced Emission Spectroscopy:- </i></b>Rotational, vibrational or
electronic transitions can be associated with suitable molecular properties
using hyperlinks.  We have illustrated this with a laser excitation spectrum
derived from jet-cooled molecules, for which the rotational fine structure on a
vibrational band is evident. The particular rotational transitions can be
hyperlinked to the output from a normal coordinate analysis program and which
can be animated on the screen to illustrate the relevant normal mode. We have
also applied animations to showing the results of molecular dynamics
calculations on <i>e.g.</i> the folding of a small oligonucleotide. <p>
<p>
<b><i>Complex Reaction or Metabolic Schemes:-  </i></b>A complex scheme showing
<i>e.g.</i> the synthesis of the natural product papuamine<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[20]</a> can require substantial
annotation with reagents, specific comments about individual reactions or
functional group transformations and perhaps reference to crystallographic
determinations of key structures and spectroscopic data. This applies equally
to complex metabolic schemes, where the substrates and enzymes can be
individually annotated. By adding hyperlinks to e.g. a scheme illustrating the
Citric acid cycle (Figure 4), such supplemental data can be viewed when
required. More complex hyperlinks to remotely stored chemical databases and
index based searches, to further such schemes, or to other scientific
publications published in hypertext form can be added.<p>
<p>
<b><A HREF="fig4.gif">Figure 4 here</A></b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>Other Applications of Hyperactive Molecules:-  </i></b>We anticipate that
numerous other applications of these techniques might arise. For example, peaks
in one and two dimensional chromatograms could be hyperlinked to appropriate
molecular coordinates or amino acid or DNA sequences. The concept that a reader
can readily evaluate the conclusions presented in a paper by having access to
the original data almost instantly, has profound implications for the quality
and reproducibility of chemical  information.<p>
<p>
Molecular co-ordinates need not even be stored on any computer system, but can
be generated as required. For example, the Klotho project<a
href="4_05970K_fn.html#fn0">[21]</a> may be a forerunner of a
system where a chemical name entered by a remote user is automatically
translated into a SMILES string using defined grammar and vocabulary, and the
SMILES string is then used to generate pseudo pdb style molecular co-ordinates
which are then returned to the user in a form suitable for viewing with
<i>e.g.</i> RasMol. Such a system could greatly facilitate the semi-automated
"marking-up" of synthetic, spectroscopic and other data. <p>
<p>
This system also anticipates how the chemical indexing of molecular data might
be achieved using an "agent" roaming the Internet searching for specified
chemical MIME types. Depending on the sophistication of this agent, it is easy
to imagine novel correlations between widely disparate molecule data being
discovered <i>via</i> such automatic mechanisms. In a sense, the World-Wide-Web
becomes another chemistry research tool, from which original and perhaps even
general conclusions can be drawn. One might imagine for example such an agent
"discovering" the Woodward-Hoffmann rules by scouring the Internet for all
published examples of pericyclic reactions and comparing the three dimensional
connectivity data to see if general results regarding the stereochemistry might
be inferred. <p>
<p>
<b><i>Molecular Videoconferencing:</i></b> A simple extension to the
client-server model of information exchange would be to allow peer-to-peer
collaborative visualisation of molecular data initiated by means of a
World-Wide-Web hyperlink. When a hyperlink is activated to display a particular
co-ordinate set, a synchronous window is simultaneously created on one or more
remote computer screens associated with collaborators on the project, perhaps
with an associated videoconferencing and audio link. The collaborators in
effect share a molecular "white board" within which they can manipulate and
edit the molecular data to their joint satisfaction, and save the results
simultaneously at both sites. Such methods of working require a rather more
sophisticated network infra-structure, possibly based on ATM (Asynchronous
Transport Mode) or IPNG (Internet Protocol New Generation) networking
protocols. We have recently demonstrated such a collaborative conferencing
session between laboratories in London and Leeds, over the U.K.'s SuperJANET
network.<p>
<p>
<b><i>Conclusions: </i></b>Whilst the mechanisms described in this paper are
far from being in common use, the first stage of providing readily accessible
"live" chemical information in a potentially globally searchable form has
clearly been achieved. Chemical problems that still need to be solved are how
to index such hyperactive molecular information in a chemically cognisant
sense, and how to improve the metaphors for navigating through such information
such as mapping three dimensional molecular co-ordinates in a useful sense,
<i>e.g. </i>to highlight active sites and other interesting regions. Other
issues also require urgent attention. For example, for how long should any
given data be expected to reside in automatically accessible form on the
Internet? Could it be eventually archived in a manner that would still allow
its retrieval using the mechanisms described here. Should the data reside only
under the control of "trusted" agencies, or would data remaining under the
control of its originators have to be "authenticated" using some form of
digital signature. Nor is it clear where the cost recovery mechanisms of this
new infra-structure would reside. Assuming solutions are found for such
problems, it might be anticipated that the conventional scientific journal
might change more rapidly over the next few years than it has in the last
hundred.<p>
