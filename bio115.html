<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="6">Division: <b>Myxomycota</b></font><font

face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"> </font></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Members of this division are commonly referred to

as slime molds. Although presently classified as <strong>Protozoans</strong>, in the

Kingdom <b>Protista</b>, slime molds were once thought to be fungi (=kingdom <b>Mycetae</b>)

because they produce <b>spores</b> that are borne in <b>sporangia</b>, a characteristic

common to some taxa of fungi. However, the assimilative stage in slime molds is

morphologically similar to that of an amoeba. This assimilative stage has been designated

a <b>myxamoeba</b> (Fig 1). The myxamoeba, as is the case of the amoeba, is a uninucleate,

haploid cell which is <em>not</em> enclosed in a rigid cell wall, and ingests its food by

means of <b>phagocytosis</b>. During this mode of ingestion, the food particles, usually

bacteria, beceome surrounded by the <strong>pseudopodia</strong> of the myxamoeba. Once

the food has been engulfed in this matter, it is surrounded by a membrane or <strong>food

vacuole</strong> where hydrolytic enzymes are secreted that will digest the food.&nbsp; In

fungi, the assimilative stages are <b>mycelium </b>and <b>yeast</b>, both of which are

surrounded by a rigid cell wall and obtain their food by means of absorption. These are

some of the reasons why mycologists no longer recognize slime molds as being fungi.

However, organisms in this group continue to be studied in mycology as a matter of

tradition and not because they are thought to be related to fungi. Within the Myxomycota,

the class Myxomycetes, often referred to as the <strong>acellular slime molds</strong>,

will be the only class that we will consider.</font></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="6">Class: <b>Myxomycetes</b></font><font

face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"> </font></p>

<font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">



<p>There are approximately 500 species of Myxomycetes. They are found on moist soil,

decaying wood, and dung. One of the more interesting characteristic about this group of

organisms is that while the species of other organisms will vary in different geographical

localities, i.e. you don't find the same species of plants and animals on the mainland

that you find in Hawai&#145;i, this is not generally true in the Myxomycetes. Most species

can be found throughout the world.</font></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="6"><strong>Life Cycle of Myxomycetes</strong></font></p>



<p><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Introduction</font></strong></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"><u>Physarum</u> <u>polycephalum</u> and <u>Didymium</u>

<u>iridis</u> will be used to represent the Myxomycete life cycle and when possible,

pictures of these species will be used to illustrate the various parts of the life cycle.

These two species were selected since a great deal of researach has been carried out with

these species and their life cycles are well known. However, since other species may

differ somewhat in their life cycles, some of these variations will also be described.</font></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"><strong>Spore Germination, Myxamoebae and Swarm

Cells</strong></font></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">The spores of Myxomycetes are normally globose,

uninucelate and haploid. The spore surface may range from almost smooth to reticulate.

Spores of <u>P</u>. <u>polycephalum</u> and <u>D</u>. <u>iridis</u> are spiny. The spore

wall is composed primarily of cellulose and is only one of two stages where a cell wall is

formed. The other stage that forms a cell wall is the microcyst, which is discussed below.

Upon germination, the spore will crack open and release a single, uninucelate myxamoeba.

The myxamoeba moves by amoeboid motion and ingest food, by phagocytosis, as it does so. As

the myxamoebae feeds and grows, they will reproduce, <em>asexually</em>, by mitosis and

cytokinesis.</font></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">The myxamoeba stage may continue to proliferate for

an indefinite period of time if there is available nutrient and the environment remains

favorable. In most species, the myxamoeba stage may also vary according to the

environment. When free water is available myxamoeba can differentiate into flagellated <strong>swarm

cells</strong> (Fig 4-5). Although two flagella are present, One the long, anteriorly

directed flagellum is visible. The second, very short flagellum is usually not visible.

During periods of unfavorable conditions, the protoplast of the myxamoeba or swarm cell

can round up and form a thin, cellulose&nbsp; protecetive layer around itself, called the <b>microcyst</b>

(Fig 6), which will protect it from the environment.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Zygote and Plasmodium Formation</font></strong></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">After a period of time, when a <em>critical number</em>

of swarm cells or myxamoebae are formed, sexual reproduction will occur and these

vegetative stages will then function as gametes. In <u>P</u>. <u>polycephalum</u>, it is

the swarm cells that normally act as gametes. Gametes that are all derived from a common

myxamoeba, however, are usually <em>self sterile</em>. In order for syngamy to occur,

gametes that are derived from a different population of myxamoebae, <em>and </em>of a

different mating strain, are required before syngamy can take place. By convention, the

different mating strains are designated as a</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">1</font><font

face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">, a</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">2</font><font

face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">, a</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">3</font><font

face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">, etc. and in order for syngamy to occur, the myxamoebae

must be of <em>different</em> mating strains, e.g., a</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"

size="4">1</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"> </font><font face="Comic Sans MS"

size="4">X</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"> a</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"

size="4">X</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5"> a</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"

size="4">3</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">, etc. Once compatible mating strains

have come into contact with one another, syngamy will occur to form the zygote. The zygote

then undergo numerous mitotic divisions to form the large, multinucleate plasmodium. This

class is commonly referred to as the <em>acellular slime molds</em> because the <b>plasmodium</b>

(Figs. 7-8) stage of the lifecycle is <em>not</em> composed of many cells. Instead it is

essentially a <em>single, multinucleate cell</em>. As in the myxamoebae stage, the

plasmodium is also an assimilative stage that consumes food by phagocytosis.&nbsp;

However, the plasmodium is a diploid structure and is many magnitudes larger. The

appearance of the plasmodium is variable. In&nbsp; <u>P</u>. <u>polycephalum</u> (Fig. 7),

it is a bright yellow, slimy structure while in <u>D</u>. <u>iridis</u> (Fig 8), the

plasmodium is colorless. When unfavorable conditions prevail, the plasmodium forms a

protective, brittle layer and becomes dormant. This dormant stage is termed a <strong>sclerotium</strong>

(Fig. 9), and if observed under the microscope, it can be observed to be composed of a

number of smaller multinucleate cells called <strong>macrocysts</strong> (Fig 10). Upon

return of favorable conditions, each macrocyst can give rise to a new plasmodium.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Formation of Sporangia</font></strong></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">During favorable conditions, the plasmodium will

migrate and feed for a period of time before being converted to numerous sporangia. In <u>P</u>.

<u>polycephalum</u>, it is believed that the exhaustion of food is one of the stimuli that

induces formation of sporangia because as long as adequate food is present in this

species, the plasmodium stage will persist. Light appears to be another stimulus to

fruiting in this species.</font></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">The form and color of sporangia are variable. In <u>D</u>.

<u>iridis</u>, a light blue, more or less globose sporangium is produced on a yellowish

stipe (Fig. 11) while in <u>P</u>. <u>polycephalum</u> the sporangium is a dark gray to

almost black, lobed sporangium that is produced on a yellowish stipe (Fig. 12). The

fragile, outer layer of the sporangium is the <strong>peridium</strong> (pl.=peridia),

which may be persistent or degenerate by the time the sporangium is ready to disperse its

spores. </font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">When sporangium formation begins, the plasmodium

becomes denser and forms a thick sheet called the <strong>hypothallus</strong> (Fig. 11).

The protoplasm of the plasmodium then becomes knotted into discrete nodules (Fig. 12),

which represent the sporangial primordia. The individual nodules initially elongates (Fig.

13) and as development continues the basal portion, which will become the stalk, decreases

in diameter while the upper portion becomes the sporangium proper and will develop the

finger-like projection characteristic of <u>P</u>. <u>polycephalum</u> (Fig.14). In <u>D</u>.

<u>iridis</u>, the sporangium would become a single, globose sac.</font></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Upon the completion of movement of protoplasm into

the sporangium proper, the stalk has now become more constricted and is devoid of

protoplasm. Spore formation comes about with the formation of cell walls around the

diploid nuclei. The nucleus in each spore will undergo meiosis to produce four 1N nuclei.

Of these, <em>three</em> will degenerate. Thus, only <em>one</em> myxamoebae results from

each spore. Also throughout the interior of the sporangium is the branched, thread-like <strong>capillitium</strong>.

The capillitium arises from coalescene of vacuoles, which contain various material from

the protplasm, especially calcium cabonate (CaCO</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">3</font><font

<p><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Variations in Capillitium Morphology</font></strong></p>



<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5">Capillitium (pl.=capillitia) are filamentous

structures that usually develop with spores within sporangia. They are thought to function

in the retention of spores in the sporangia. By retaining spores the capillitium will

allow gradual dispersal of spores over a long period of time. Thus, if over a period of

time there are occasions when dispersal of spores will be unfavorable for myxamoebal and

plasmodial growth, some spores will always be retained that will be dispersed at a later,

possibly more favorable period. Capillitia are often ornamented and have been used in

defining some taxa in Myxomycetes. Some variations are illustrated below:</font></p>
